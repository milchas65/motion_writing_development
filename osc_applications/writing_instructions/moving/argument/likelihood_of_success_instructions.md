# Likelihood of Success Instructions (OSC Support)

This file provides detailed guidance on establishing **likelihood of success on the merits** in support of a preliminary injunction or TRO application.

## The Standard

Movant must demonstrate a **likelihood of success on the merits**—not certainty, but a reasonable probability of prevailing.

> "To satisfy the likelihood-of-success prong, the movant need not show that success is an 'absolute certainty.' Rather, he must make a 'clear showing' that he is likely to succeed." *Oneida Nation of N.Y. v. Cuomo*, 645 F.3d 154, 164 (2d Cir. 2011).

### Alternative Standard (Some Jurisdictions)
In certain circumstances, courts apply a lower standard:
- **Serious questions going to the merits** + balance of hardships tips decidedly in movant's favor

This sliding scale is available in the Second Circuit but requires a stronger showing on the balance of hardships.

## Approach by Claim Type

### Contract Claims
Establish:
1. Valid, enforceable contract
2. Movant's performance or excuse
3. Defendant's breach
4. Resulting harm

**Focus on:**
- Clear contract language supporting your position
- Documentary evidence of breach
- Absence of valid defenses

**Example language:**
> "The Agreement unambiguously provides that [quote relevant provision]. [Defendant's] conduct—[describe breach]—constitutes a clear violation of this provision. [Defendant] has no legitimate defense."

**Detailed Contract Breach Framework (from Art Capital Doc 5):**
Structure your argument around three pillars:

1. **No justification for defendant's action**
   > "[Defendant's] purported [action] is invalid because [specific reason]. The Agreement does not authorize such conduct under these circumstances."

2. **Plaintiff in full compliance**
   > "[Movant] has fully performed its obligations under the Agreement, including [specific obligations]. [Movant] has not breached any provision that would excuse [Defendant's] performance."

3. **Specific procedural defects**
   > "[Defendant] failed to comply with the Agreement's procedural requirements. Section [X] requires [specific procedure], but [Defendant] [describe failure]."

**Cite exact contract provisions** — reference specific sections (e.g., "Section 5(b)(i)," "Section 5(d)") to demonstrate precision and command of the agreement.

### Tort Claims
Establish:
1. Duty owed
2. Breach of duty
3. Causation
4. Damages

**Focus on:**
- Clear duty (statutory, common law, or contractual)
- Specific conduct constituting breach
- Direct link to harm

### Statutory Claims
Establish:
1. Applicable statute
2. Defendant's conduct violates statute
3. Movant has standing/is within protected class
4. Remedy available

**Focus on:**
- Statutory text and any relevant regulations
- Legislative intent
- Agency interpretations if applicable

### Intellectual Property Claims
Establish:
1. Valid IP right (ownership, registration)
2. Infringement/misappropriation
3. No valid defense (fair use, license, etc.)

**Focus on:**
- Chain of ownership
- Scope of protection
- Evidence of copying/use

## Techniques for Establishing Likelihood of Success

### 1. Lead with Your Strongest Arguments
Structure the section to front-load your most compelling points:
- Clear documentary evidence
- Unambiguous contract language
- Admissions by defendant

### 2. Address Key Elements Systematically
For each cause of action:
- State the legal standard
- Apply facts to each element
- Cite supporting evidence

**Example structure:**
> "To prevail on its breach of contract claim, [Movant] must establish: (1) a valid contract; (2) [Movant's] performance; (3) [Defendant's] breach; and (4) resulting damages. [Movant] readily satisfies each element."

### 3. Anticipate and Rebut Defenses
Don't ignore obvious defenses—address them proactively:
- Acknowledge the defense
- Explain why it fails
- Cite authority if available

**Example language:**
> "[Defendant] may argue that [defense]. This argument fails because [reason]. See [case] (rejecting similar defense under analogous circumstances)."

### 4. Use Evidence Strategically
Cite specific evidence throughout:
- Contracts and agreements
- Correspondence and communications
- Financial records
- Expert reports
- Declarations with personal knowledge

**Example language:**
> "The evidence is undisputed: [Defendant's] own email confirms that [quote or describe]. (Ex. A at 2.) This admission alone establishes [Movant's] likelihood of success."

### 5. Distinguish Adverse Authority
If opponent has favorable cases:
- Distinguish on facts
- Distinguish on procedural posture
- Argue for better rule
- Note minority/majority positions

## Common Claim-Specific Frameworks

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty
1. Existence of fiduciary relationship
2. Breach of duty (loyalty, care, disclosure)
3. Damages

**Key point:** Fiduciary relationships require heightened duties—emphasize defendant's position of trust.

### Fraud/Misrepresentation
1. False representation of material fact
2. Knowledge of falsity (scienter)
3. Intent to induce reliance
4. Justifiable reliance
5. Resulting damages

**Key point:** Must plead with particularity—who, what, when, where, why.

### Conversion
1. Movant's ownership or right to possession
2. Defendant's unauthorized exercise of dominion
3. Damages

**Key point:** Distinguish from contract claims where same conduct alleged.

### Trade Secret Misappropriation
1. Existence of trade secret
2. Reasonable measures to maintain secrecy
3. Misappropriation (acquisition, disclosure, or use)

**Key point:** Detail the steps taken to protect confidentiality.

## Addressing Weaknesses

### Factual Disputes
Courts generally don't resolve credibility at preliminary injunction stage:
- Acknowledge dispute exists
- Argue your version is better supported
- Note that full record will confirm your position

**Example language:**
> "While [Defendant] may dispute [specific fact], the documentary evidence—including [evidence]—overwhelmingly supports [Movant's] account. At minimum, [Movant] has shown a likelihood of success sufficient to warrant preliminary relief."

### Novel Legal Issues
If your position requires extending existing law:
- Anchor in existing principles
- Show logical extension
- Cite policy considerations
- Note trend in other jurisdictions

### Missing Evidence
If key evidence is not yet available:
- Explain what discovery will reveal
- Note that defendant controls relevant evidence
- Argue inferences should favor movant

## Jurisdiction-Specific Considerations

### New York State
CPLR § 6301 governs preliminary injunctions. The three-part test requires:
1. Likelihood of success on the merits
2. Irreparable injury absent preliminary relief
3. Balance of equities favors movant

**Key cases:**
- *Nobu Next Door, LLC v. Fine Arts Hous., Inc.*, 4 N.Y.3d 839 (2005) — standard three-part test
- *Goldstone v. Gracie Terrace Apt. Corp.*, 110 A.D.3d 101 (1st Dep't 2013)

**Handling factual disputes (CPLR § 6312(c)):**
> Factual disputes alone do not defeat a preliminary injunction motion.

Cite CPLR § 6312(c) defensively when opponent raises disputed facts:
> "CPLR § 6312(c) permits the court to grant preliminary relief notwithstanding the existence of disputed factual issues. The Court need not resolve every factual dispute at this stage."

### Federal (Second Circuit)
- Primary standard: likelihood of success
- Alternative: serious questions + hardships tip decidedly to movant
- *Citigroup Global Mkts., Inc. v. VCG Special Opportunities Master Fund Ltd.*, 598 F.3d 30 (2d Cir. 2010)

## Template Language

### Opening the Section
> "[Movant] is likely to succeed on the merits of its [identify claims]. The evidence demonstrates that [Defendant] [briefly describe wrongful conduct], in clear violation of [legal standard]."

### Transitioning Between Claims
> "[Movant] is also likely to succeed on its [additional claim]."

### Addressing the Standard
> "To obtain a preliminary injunction, movant need not prove its case in full. Rather, movant must demonstrate a 'likelihood of success'—a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits. [Citation.] [Movant] readily satisfies this standard."

### Closing the Section
> "For these reasons, [Movant] has demonstrated a clear likelihood of success on the merits of its claims."

## Special Applications

### Injunction Modification (CPLR 2221)

When seeking to modify a prior injunction based on changed circumstances:

**Legal standard:**
> "Pursuant to CPLR 2221, the Court is empowered to modify the Injunction upon the [Party's] motion, on notice."

**Framework (from Art Capital Doc 103):**
1. Identify the specific changed circumstance (e.g., loan default, contract termination)
2. Explain how the change affects the injunction's underlying basis
3. Show that modification is necessary to permit exercise of contractual or legal rights
4. Demonstrate that the original reasons for the injunction no longer apply

**Example language:**
> "The circumstances underlying the Injunction have materially changed. When the Court entered the Injunction on [date], [describe original circumstances]. Now that [changed circumstance], the basis for the Injunction no longer exists, and [Movant] is entitled to exercise the rights that accrue upon [triggering event]."

**Key technique:** If the court made favorable observations in prior proceedings, quote them to support modification. Courts are generally receptive to their own prior statements.
