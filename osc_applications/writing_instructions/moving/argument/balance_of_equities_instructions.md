# Balance of Equities Instructions (OSC Support)

This file provides detailed guidance on establishing that the **balance of equities** favors preliminary injunctive relief.

## The Standard

The balance of equities (also called "balance of hardships") weighs:
- **Harm to movant** if relief is denied
- **Harm to defendant** if relief is granted
- **Public interest** considerations (especially in federal court)

> "In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of injunction." *Winter v. NRDC*, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).

## The Core Comparison

| If Relief Is Denied | If Relief Is Granted |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| What happens to movant? | What happens to defendant? |
| Is harm irreversible? | Is burden merely temporary? |
| Can harm be remedied later? | Can defendant be compensated if movant loses? |

**Your goal:** Show that movant's harm significantly outweighs any burden on defendant.

## Techniques for Shifting the Equities

### 1. Emphasize Asymmetry of Harm
The most powerful argument: movant faces permanent harm while defendant faces only temporary inconvenience.

**Example language:**
> "The equities tip decisively in [Movant's] favor. If relief is denied, [Movant] will suffer [permanent/irreversible harm]. If relief is granted, [Defendant] will face only [temporary inconvenience/delay], which can be remedied by [money damages/bond] if [Defendant] ultimately prevails."

### 2. Frame the Status Quo Favorably
Define the "status quo" as the state before defendant's wrongful conduct:

**Strong framing:**
> "[Movant] seeks only to restore the status quo that existed before [Defendant's] wrongful conduct. This Court would not be altering the parties' relationship—it would be preserving it pending resolution on the merits."

**Weak framing (avoid):**
> "[Movant] seeks to change the current arrangement..."

### 3. Highlight Defendant's Wrongful Conduct
Emphasize that defendant's own actions created the situation:

**Example language:**
> "[Defendant] cannot now claim hardship from being enjoined from [wrongful conduct]. Any burden [Defendant] faces is a consequence of its own [breach/misconduct], not an inequity caused by this Court's intervention."

### 4. Minimize Defendant's Claimed Harm
Address and diminish defendant's anticipated arguments:
- Harm is purely economic (can be bonded)
- Harm is temporary (injunction pending trial)
- Defendant assumed risk when it engaged in conduct
- Defendant can modify its conduct to comply

**Example language:**
> "[Defendant] may claim [anticipated harm], but this burden is modest compared to the irreparable injury [Movant] will suffer. Moreover, any economic harm to [Defendant] can be addressed through the bond [Movant] is prepared to post."

### 5. The "No Prejudice" Argument
When defendant will suffer no actual harm from the injunction:

**Technique (from Art Capital Doc 5):** Show that defendant has received and will continue to receive everything it's entitled to.

**Example language:**
> "[Defendant] will suffer no prejudice from an injunction. [Defendant] has received all that it was due under the Agreement, and will continue to receive all that is due. The injunction merely prevents [Defendant] from [wrongful conduct]—conduct [Defendant] has no right to engage in regardless."

**When to use:**
- Defendant already received contractual benefits
- Injunction prevents wrongful conduct, not legitimate activity
- Defendant's only "harm" is inability to breach agreement
- Status quo maintains defendant's proper position

**Powerful because:** Completely negates defendant's side of the balance—if defendant suffers no harm, the equities necessarily tip to movant.

### 6. Address Public Interest (Federal Court)
In federal court, public interest is a separate factor:
- Policy favoring enforcement of contracts
- Policy favoring protection of IP rights
- Public safety considerations
- Regulatory enforcement interests

**Example language:**
> "The public interest also supports granting relief. The public has a strong interest in [enforcement of contractual obligations/protection of intellectual property/etc.], and denying relief would [undermine that interest]."

## Common Equitable Considerations

### Factors Favoring Movant
- **Good faith:** Movant acted reasonably throughout
- **Clean hands:** Movant did not contribute to the problem
- **Diligence:** Movant sought relief promptly
- **Innocent party:** Movant is victim of defendant's wrongdoing
- **Preservation:** Movant seeks only to maintain status quo
- **Public benefit:** Relief serves broader interests

### Factors to Address/Rebut
- **Delay:** Explain any delay in seeking relief
- **Unclean hands:** Rebut any suggestion of movant misconduct
- **Economic harm to defendant:** Minimize and bond
- **Third-party effects:** Address impact on non-parties
- **Practicability:** Show relief is workable

## Addressing the Bond/Undertaking

Proactively addressing the bond demonstrates good faith and tips equities:

**Example language:**
> "[Movant] is prepared to post an undertaking in an amount sufficient to protect [Defendant's] interests should [Defendant] ultimately prevail. This further tips the balance of equities in [Movant's] favor, as it ensures [Defendant] will be fully compensated for any harm caused by the injunction if [Movant] does not succeed on the merits."

### Bond Considerations
- Offer a reasonable bond amount
- Explain how bond addresses defendant's potential harm
- In NY, bond required under CPLR 6312(b) unless court waives
- In federal court, required under Rule 65(c) but amount flexible

## Sliding Scale Argument

In some jurisdictions, a very strong balance of equities can compensate for a weaker showing on likelihood of success:

**Example language (use cautiously):**
> "Even if this Court were to conclude that [Movant] has shown only 'serious questions going to the merits' rather than a clear likelihood of success, the balance of hardships tips so decidedly in [Movant's] favor that preliminary relief is warranted."

This is the *Citigroup* standard in the Second Circuit—available but requires a truly lopsided balance.

## Addressing Common Defense Arguments

### "Relief Will Destroy Defendant's Business"
**Response:**
> "This overstates the impact. [Defendant] will be [temporarily restrained from specific conduct], not shut down entirely. [Defendant] can [continue operations in compliant manner] pending resolution on the merits."

### "Movant Delayed in Seeking Relief"
**Response:**
> "[Movant] acted promptly upon [learning of defendant's conduct/threat becoming imminent]. [Movant's] prior [good-faith negotiations/attempts to resolve] do not constitute delay warranting denial of relief—they demonstrate [Movant's] reasonableness."

### "Movant Has Unclean Hands"
**Response:**
> "[Defendant's] accusation of unclean hands is baseless. [Movant] has acted [properly/in accordance with the contract/etc.]. Even if [Movant's] conduct were relevant—which it is not—it does not approach the level of misconduct required to invoke the unclean hands doctrine."

### "Third Parties Will Be Harmed"
**Response:**
> "[Defendant's] claimed concern for third parties is a litigation tactic. The relief sought is narrowly tailored to address [Defendant's] wrongful conduct and will not harm [identified third parties]. Moreover, any incidental effects on third parties do not outweigh the irreparable harm [Movant] will suffer absent relief."

## Template Language

### Opening the Section
> "The balance of equities tips decisively in [Movant's] favor. [Movant] faces [describe irreparable harm], while [Defendant] will suffer, at most, [minimal/temporary burden] from the requested relief."

### Comparing Harms
> "Weighing the harms, the disparity is clear: [Movant] faces [permanent/irreversible harm], while [Defendant] faces only [temporary inconvenience/economic burden that can be bonded]. The equities strongly favor granting relief."

### Status Quo Framing
> "[Movant] seeks only to preserve the status quo—the state of affairs that existed before [Defendant's] [wrongful conduct]. Granting relief will not give [Movant] anything it did not previously have; it will simply prevent [Defendant] from [continuing wrongful conduct] pending resolution on the merits."

### Closing the Section
> "For these reasons, the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of granting [Movant's] application for preliminary injunctive relief."
