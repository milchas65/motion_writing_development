# Irreparable Harm Instructions (OSC Support)

This file provides detailed guidance on establishing **irreparable harm** in support of a preliminary injunction or TRO application.

## The Standard

Irreparable harm is harm that:
1. **Cannot be remedied by money damages**, and
2. **Is imminent** (not speculative or remote)

> "A showing of irreparable harm is the single most important prerequisite for the issuance of a preliminary injunction." *Faiveley Transp. Malmo AB v. Wabtec Corp.*, 559 F.3d 110, 118 (2d Cir. 2009).

## Categories of Irreparable Harm

### 1. Loss of Unique Property or Rights
- Real property with unique characteristics
- Intellectual property (trade secrets, confidential information)
- Contract rights that are unique or irreplaceable
- Business goodwill and reputation

**Example language:**
> "The threatened disclosure of [Movant's] trade secrets would cause irreparable harm because, once disclosed, the confidential nature of this information cannot be restored."

### 2. Destruction of Business or Competitive Position
- Loss of customers/client relationships
- Destruction of market position
- Loss of competitive advantage

**Example language:**
> "[Defendant's] conduct threatens to destroy the customer relationships [Movant] has developed over [X] years—relationships that cannot be rebuilt through monetary compensation."

**Niche/Specialized Market Reputation (from Art Capital Doc 5):**
In specialized industries, reputation damage is particularly irreparable:
> "Clients in the art world will not deal with [Movant] if [Movant] is perceived as so unreliable that it can be summarily [removed/replaced] from its [role] by [Defendant]..."

**Key elements:**
- Identify the specialized/niche nature of the market
- Explain how reputation functions differently in that market
- Show that third-party confusion creates business "disarray"
- Emphasize that trust once lost cannot be rebuilt by money

### 3. Regulatory Compliance Necessity
When failure to act would expose movant to regulatory sanctions:

**Example language (from Art Capital Doc 64):**
> "[Failure to obtain relief] could subject [Movant] to regulatory sanction—that could not be remedied by [Defendant] or this Court."

**When to use:**
- External regulatory obligations (SEC, state agencies, foreign regulators)
- Professional licensing requirements
- Compliance deadlines that cannot be extended
- Audit or reporting obligations

**Powerful because:** Creates urgency beyond the private dispute—the harm comes from a third party (the regulator) that neither party can control.

### 4. Constitutional or Statutory Rights
- First Amendment violations
- Civil rights deprivations
- Statutory protections

**Example language:**
> "The deprivation of constitutional rights, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury."

### 5. Physical Harm or Safety
- Threats to health or safety
- Environmental damage
- Personal injury risk

### 6. Loss of Control Over Property or Assets
- Dissipation of assets
- Unauthorized transfer of property
- Destruction of evidence

## Techniques for Establishing Irreparable Harm

### 1. Be Specific About the Harm
**Weak:**
> "Movant will suffer irreparable harm."

**Strong:**
> "Without injunctive relief, [Defendant] will transfer the disputed assets to offshore accounts beyond the reach of this Court, leaving [Movant] without any means to recover damages even if it prevails on the merits."

### 2. Establish Imminence
Show that harm is about to occur or is ongoing:
- Cite to specific dates, deadlines, or threatened actions
- Reference communications showing defendant's intent
- Document ongoing harm that continues each day

**Example language:**
> "[Defendant] has stated—in writing—its intention to close the facility by January 15, 2025. Absent immediate relief, [Movant] will lose access to [critical asset] in a matter of days."

### 3. Explain Why Money Damages Are Inadequate
Address compensability directly:
- Harm cannot be quantified
- Defendant may be judgment-proof
- Nature of the harm is non-monetary (reputation, relationships)
- Harm is irreversible once it occurs

**Example language:**
> "Money damages cannot remedy the harm because [the confidential information], once disclosed to competitors, cannot be 'undisclosed.' The competitive advantage [Movant] has developed will be permanently destroyed."

### 4. Address Any Delay
If there was any delay in seeking relief, explain it:
- Movant acted promptly upon learning of the threat
- Earlier attempts at resolution
- Harm only became imminent recently

**Example language:**
> "[Movant] filed this application within [X] days of learning of [Defendant's] intended conduct. [Movant] previously sought to resolve this dispute through [negotiations/other means], but [Defendant's] recent [action] made clear that immediate judicial intervention is necessary."

### 5. Use Declarations Effectively
Support with specific factual averments:
- Personal knowledge of harm
- Expert testimony on irreversibility
- Industry practice regarding harm type

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Conclusory Assertions
**Bad:** "Movant will suffer irreparable harm if relief is not granted."

**Good:** "Without relief, [specific harm] will occur by [specific date], resulting in [specific irreversible consequence]."

### 2. Speculative Harm
The harm must be likely, not merely possible:
- Avoid "may" or "might" language
- Use "will" when supported by evidence
- Cite specific evidence of defendant's intentions

### 3. Self-Inflicted Harm
Courts are skeptical of harm caused by movant's own conduct:
- Frame the harm as caused by defendant
- Explain why movant's prior choices don't preclude relief

### 4. Delay in Seeking Relief
Delay undermines urgency:
- If delay exists, explain it
- Show that harm became imminent recently
- Demonstrate that movant acted promptly once harm was threatened

## New York-Specific Considerations

Under New York law:
- Economic harm alone generally does not constitute irreparable injury if it can be compensated by money damages
- Loss of goodwill and reputation can be irreparable
- Threatened breach of a negative covenant (non-compete) may warrant injunction

**Key cases:**
- *Neos v. Lacey*, 291 A.D.2d 434 (2d Dep't 2002) (loss of customers and goodwill)
- *Marietta Corp. v. Fairhurst*, 301 A.D.2d 734 (3d Dep't 2003) (breach of restrictive covenant)

## Federal Court Considerations

Under Second Circuit law:
- Must show irreparable harm is "likely," not merely possible
- Speculative harm insufficient
- Self-inflicted wounds weigh against finding irreparable harm

**Key cases:**
- *Winter v. NRDC*, 555 U.S. 7 (2008) (must show irreparable injury is likely)
- *Faiveley Transp.*, 559 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2009) (single most important prerequisite)

## Template Language

### Opening the Section
> "Absent injunctive relief, [Movant] will suffer irreparable harm that cannot be remedied by an award of money damages."

### Transitioning Between Harms
> "The threat of irreparable harm is further compounded by..."

### Addressing Imminence
> "This harm is not speculative—it is imminent. [Defendant] has [stated its intention/taken concrete steps] to [harmful action], and absent this Court's intervention, [specific harm] will occur within [timeframe]."

### Closing the Section
> "For these reasons, [Movant] has demonstrated the irreparable harm necessary to warrant preliminary injunctive relief."
