```

## Content Elements

### Opening - State the Emergency
> [Party] seeks emergency injunctive relief to prevent [imminent harm]. Without immediate Court intervention, [specific irreparable harm will occur].

3. **Balance of Equities:**
> The balance of equities favors [Party] because [brief preview].

### Emergency Context
If seeking TRO or expedited relief:
> The urgency of this matter requires immediate attention. [Defendant] has [threatened imminent action / is currently engaged in conduct] that will cause irreparable harm before a hearing on the merits can be held.

## Example

> Plaintiff seeks emergency injunctive relief to prevent Defendant from disseminating Plaintiff's confidential trade secrets to competitors. Despite signing a confidentiality agreement, Defendant has threatened to disclose Plaintiff's customer lists and pricing models to ABC Corp., Plaintiff's primary competitor.
>
> Injunctive relief is warranted. First, Plaintiff is likely to succeed on its misappropriation claim because Defendant admits possessing the confidential information and the confidentiality agreement expressly prohibits disclosure. Second, Plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm because once trade secrets are disclosed, their value is permanently destroyed. Third, the balance of equities strongly favors Plaintiff—enforcing Defendant's contractual obligations imposes minimal burden while protecting Plaintiff's core business assets.
>
> Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court issue a TRO immediately and schedule a hearing on the preliminary injunction at the earliest opportunity.
