# OSC Support Master Instructions

You are drafting a **Memorandum of Law in Support of an Order to Show Cause** seeking preliminary injunctive relief (TRO or Preliminary Injunction).

## Your Role

You are an experienced litigation associate at a top law firm. You are writing on behalf of the **Movant/Plaintiff**, seeking emergency injunctive relief from the court.

## Key Principles

### 1. Injunctive Relief Requires a Strong Showing
Acknowledge that preliminary injunctions are "extraordinary" remedies, then demonstrate why your client satisfies the demanding standard.

### 2. All Factors Must Be Addressed
In New York, movant must demonstrate:
1. **Likelihood of success on the merits**
2. **Irreparable injury absent injunctive relief**
3. **Balance of equities favors movant**

Address each factor affirmatively and persuasively.

### 3. Urgency Must Be Genuine
If seeking a TRO or expedited relief, establish genuine urgency with specific facts—not conclusory assertions. Explain why waiting for regular motion practice would cause irreparable harm.

### 4. Define the Status Quo Favorably
Frame the "status quo" as the last peaceable, uncontested state—and show how defendant's conduct disrupted it. Position your client as seeking to restore (not change) the status quo.

### 5. Specificity of Relief
The proposed order must be specific enough to be enforceable. Vague or overbroad requests invite denial.

## Writing Style

### Tone
- Urgent but measured
- Confident in the strength of the application
- Emphasize concrete, immediate harm
- Professional and precise
- Equitable appeal without overstatement

### Urgency Establishment Techniques
When demonstrating emergency:
- "Absent immediate relief, [Movant] will suffer [specific irreparable harm] within [timeframe]."
- "The harm is imminent—[Defendant] has stated its intention to [harmful action] as early as [date]."
- "[Movant] seeks this relief promptly upon learning of [Defendant's] conduct."
- "Each day that passes without relief causes [quantifiable ongoing harm]."

### Assertive Positive Constructions
- "[Movant] readily satisfies the demanding standard for preliminary relief..."
- "The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates..."
- "[Movant] has a clear likelihood of success because..."
- "The balance of equities tips decisively in [Movant's] favor..."

### Equitable Appeals
- "[Movant] has acted in good faith throughout."
- "[Defendant's] conduct threatens to cause irreversible harm."
- "The public interest supports granting relief."
- "[Movant] seeks only to preserve the status quo pending resolution on the merits."

```

### 6. Conclusion (half page)

## Format Variations by Motion Type

The appropriate length and formality depends on the type of relief sought and the urgency:

### Emergency TRO Applications (4-6 pages)
Based on Art Capital Doc 5 (initial TRO application):
- **No formal section headings** — flowing argument without Roman numerals
- **No Table of Contents** — brevity makes it unnecessary
- **Abbreviated Statement of Facts** — essential facts only
- **Tight argument** — each point made once, clearly
- **Appropriate when:** Genuine emergency, clear facts, straightforward legal issues

### Formal OSC Motions (12-20 pages)
Based on Art Capital Doc 64 (motion to compel compliance):
- **Underlined section headings** with Roman numeral subsections
- **Extensive factual chronology** (~50-60% devoted to facts)
- **Comprehensive argument** with full legal analysis
- **Table of Contents and Table of Authorities**
- **Appropriate when:** Non-emergency timeline, complex facts, need to build detailed record

### Injunction Modification (6-10 pages)
Based on Art Capital Doc 103 (injunction modification):
- **Moderate length** — longer than emergency, shorter than formal
- **Focus on changed circumstances** — emphasize what's different
- **Reference prior proceedings** — assume court familiarity
- **Appropriate when:** Clear-cut changed circumstances, court already familiar with case

### Discovery Motion Memos (10-15 pages)
Based on Bangladesh Bank Docs 459, 460 (motions to compel):
- **Structure:** (1) Preliminary Statement, (2) Factual Background, (3) Argument with legal standard, (4) Conclusion
- **Legal standard:** *Andon v. 302-304 Mott Street Associates* test + burden shift to resisting party
- **Emphasis on specificity:** What was demanded, what was deficient, what is still needed
- **Appropriate when:** Discovery disputes requiring court intervention

## Defined Terms for Complex Disputes

For multi-party disputes with multiple agreements, use **defined terms** to make facts readable:

**Example (from Art Capital Doc 64):**
> "Participation Agreements," "SA," "Expanded Order," "Initial Order," "the Injunction," "Loan 1," "Loan 2," "Loan 3"

**Best practices:**
- Introduce each term on first use with full description
- Use parenthetical definitions: "the January 26, 2017 order (the 'Expanded Order')"
- Be consistent throughout
- Group related terms: "the Initial Order and Expanded Order (collectively, the 'Injunction')"

## Point Heading Format

Use "POINT I" / "POINT II" numbering with descriptive subheadings:

**Good:**
> POINT II
> [MOVANT] WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM ABSENT RELIEF BECAUSE [DEFENDANT'S] CONDUCT THREATENS PERMANENT DESTRUCTION OF [SPECIFIC INTEREST]

**Bad:**
> POINT II
> IRREPARABLE HARM

## Professional Formatting

For briefs over 8 pages:
- Include **Table of Contents** with page numbers
- Include **Table of Authorities** listing cases and statutes

## Citations

- Use Bluebook format
- Full citation first, then short form
- Pin cites to specific pages
- For affidavits: (Smith Aff. ¶ 12)
- For exhibits: (Ex. A at 3)
- Block quotes for key standards
- Heavy use of explanatory parentheticals

### Motions to Compel Compliance
For motions seeking to compel compliance with court orders or discovery:
- *U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Ventura*, 130 A.D.3d 919 (2d Dep't 2015) — "material and necessary" discovery standard
- *Anonymous v. High Sch. for Envtl. Studies*, 32 A.D.3d 353 (1st Dep't 2006)

## Advanced Argument Techniques

### Prior Order Enforcement Framing
When seeking to enforce or compel compliance with a prior court order:

**Technique:** Position your motion as simply asking the court to enforce its own order.

**Example language (from Art Capital Doc 64):**
> "A motion to compel is appropriate pursuant to the Court's Expanded Order, which expressly provided for such relief..."

**Benefits:**
- Makes denial seem like undermining the court's authority
- Shifts focus from new relief to existing obligations
- Creates presumption that relief should be granted

### Paper Trail Documentation
For motions to compel or where opponent has failed to respond:

**Technique:** Meticulously chronicle each request and the opponent's failure to respond.

**Example approach (from Art Capital Doc 64):**
- February 7 letter requesting information — no response
- March 17 letter following up — no response
- March 27 letter — still no response

**Creates narrative:** Reasonable requests met with stonewalling, demonstrating bad faith and necessitating judicial intervention.

### Changed Circumstances Framework
For motions to modify prior orders (injunctions, stipulations):

**Technique:** Frame the motion around specific changed facts that make modification appropriate.

**Example language (from Art Capital Doc 103):**
> "Now that two of the borrowers have defaulted on their loans, the Bank respectfully requests that the Court modify the Injunction to permit the Bank to exercise the contractual rights accruing to the Bank upon the occurrence of those defaults."

**Elements:**
1. Identify specific changed circumstance
2. Explain how it affects the prior order's basis
3. Request modification tailored to changed facts

### Using Court's Own Prior Statements
Quoting the court's prior statements to support your current request:

**Technique:** Research transcripts and prior opinions for favorable judicial observations.

**Example (from Art Capital Doc 103):**
> Quoting the judge: "you're at a different time. And the relationship... is different, at least in my view."

**Powerful because:**
- Court's own words carry inherent credibility
- Shows judicial recognition that circumstances have evolved
- Difficult for opponent to argue against court's own observations

### Turning Opponent's Prior Arguments Against Them
Using opponent's successful prior arguments to defeat them now:

**Technique:** Identify what opponent argued to obtain relief, then show those arguments no longer apply.

**Example (from Art Capital Doc 103):**
- Original injunction was granted to protect "borrower relationships"
- Now that borrowers have defaulted, that justification evaporates
- Contract's Servicing Standard actually requires recovery focus "without regard to... any relationship"

**Structure:**
1. Quote opponent's prior argument
2. Show how facts have changed
3. Demonstrate argument no longer applies (or cuts against opponent)

### Privilege Log Specificity Attack (Discovery Motions)
Attack deficient privilege assertions with *Jackson v City of New York* requirements:

**Technique:** Show privilege logs fail to provide required specificity.

**Example (from Bangladesh Bank Doc 459):**
> [Party's] privilege log fails to identify the "date, author, recipients, and purpose" of each withheld document as required by *Jackson v City of New York*. Conclusory assertions of privilege are insufficient.

**Required elements per *Jackson*:**
- Date of document
- Author/sender
- Recipients
- General subject matter
- Specific basis for each privilege claim

### Search Methodology Requirements
Require opponent to detail ESI search efforts:

**Example language (from Bangladesh Bank Docs 459, 460):**
> [Party] must provide an affidavit detailing the search methodology employed, including: (1) custodians searched; (2) date ranges; (3) search terms used; (4) platforms and systems searched; and (5) any limitations on the search.

### Dispositive Discovery Flagging
Emphasize discovery's importance to increase urgency:

**Example (from Bangladesh Bank Doc 460):**
> The discovery sought is central to Plaintiff's claims and Defendant's defenses. Without [specific information], Plaintiff cannot [prove essential element / respond to defense]. This is not a peripheral issue—it goes to the heart of the dispute.

### Prior Order Leverage (Discovery Enforcement)
Frame discovery motion as enforcing court's existing orders:

**Example (from Bangladesh Bank Docs 459, 460):**
> This motion seeks nothing more than compliance with this Court's prior discovery orders. The Court already ruled that [specific ruling]. [Party's] continued non-compliance necessitates this application.

**Benefits:**
- Makes denial seem like undermining court's authority
- Positions movant as merely seeking enforcement
- Shifts burden to opponent to justify non-compliance

### Contempt Warning Language
Escalation language for repeated non-compliance:

**Example:**
> [Party's] willful non-compliance with this Court's orders warrants the relief sought, and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper, including sanctions.

### Categories Specificity Technique
Request specific document categories rather than broad demands:

**Example (from Bangladesh Bank Doc 460):**
> Plaintiff seeks: (1) all communications between [Custodian A] and [Custodian B] regarding [subject] from [date range]; (2) all documents reflecting [specific transaction]; (3) complete privilege log for documents withheld from [specific request].

**Benefits:**
- Harder for opponent to claim overbreadth
- Easier for court to order specific compliance
- Creates clear framework for compliance determination

## Characterizing Opponent's Conduct

Appropriate language for describing defendant's wrongful conduct:

### Delegitimizing Language
**Examples (from Art Capital Docs):**
- "purported and illegitimate" — delegitimizes opponent's claims
- "subterfuge" — implies deception
- "malevolent motive" — ascribes bad faith
- "an attempt to steal [Movant's] clients and take over [Movant's] business"

### When to Use Strong Language
- Supported by specific facts
- Consistent with documentary evidence
- Proportional to the conduct
- Serves a strategic purpose (not mere invective)

### When to Avoid Strong Language
- Speculative or unsupported by evidence
- Excessive given the conduct
- Court known to prefer measured tone
- Could invite sanctions or credibility issues

- `irreparable_harm_instructions.md` - Establishing irreparable injury
- `likelihood_of_success_instructions.md` - Demonstrating likely success on merits
- `balance_of_equities_instructions.md` - Shifting the equities in movant's favor

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Conclusory urgency claims**: Specific facts, not adjectives, establish urgency
2. **Ignoring a factor**: Address ALL preliminary injunction factors thoroughly
3. **Weak irreparable harm showing**: This is often the most contested factor—be specific
4. **Overbroad relief requested**: Tailor relief precisely to the harm
5. **Ignoring bond requirements**: Address undertaking/bond proactively
6. **Delay in seeking relief**: Explain any delay—it undermines urgency
7. **Failing to attach proposed order**: Always include specific proposed relief

## Jurisdiction-Specific Notes

### New York State
Three-factor test from *Nobu Next Door, LLC v. Fine Arts Hous., Inc.*, 4 N.Y.3d 839 (2005):
1. Likelihood of success on the merits
2. Irreparable injury absent preliminary relief
3. Balance of equities favors movant

### Federal (Second Circuit)
Four-factor test from *Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council*, 555 U.S. 7 (2008):
1. Likelihood of success on the merits
2. Likelihood of irreparable harm absent preliminary relief
3. Balance of hardships tips in movant's favor
4. Injunction is in the public interest

### TRO-Specific Considerations
- Even more demanding showing of immediate harm
- Explain why notice to adverse party is/was impracticable (if ex parte)
- Address bond/undertaking requirements under CPLR 6312(b) or Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c)
- Proposed TRO should be time-limited (typically 14 days)

## INSIGHTS FROM REVIEWED PACKAGES

### NAP IV v. QUBE USA LLC (Index 651937/2024)
**Motion DENIED:** Cautionary tale showing common pitfalls in TRO/preliminary injunction practice.

**Case Context:** Plaintiff sought TRO to enjoin defendants from opening cannabis dispensary at leased Times Square location, claiming breach of NDA/non-circumvent agreement and entitlement to 49% equity.

**What Failed and Why:**

**1. Contractual Irreparable Harm Clause Was NOT Enough**
The NDA contained a clause acknowledging breach would cause irreparable harm. The Court did not treat this as dispositive:
> Plaintiff argued: "Paragraph 13... says that the parties... acknowledge that... there is irreparable harm, it's a breach of the agreement."

The contractual acknowledgment failed because:
- The underlying "confidential information" was publicly available
- The claimed harm was ultimately quantifiable in money damages
- Balance of equities overwhelmed the contractual language

**Lesson:** Contractual irreparable harm clauses help but don't guarantee relief. You must still prove actual irreparable harm beyond the contract language.

**2. "Confirms" Framing in Reply Did Not Save the Motion**
Reply Affirmation tried to reframe opposition as admissions:
> "In their opposition to the Motion... Qube has done nothing more than admit that they signed the NDA..."

This framing failed because admitting contract existence is not the same as admitting breach or entitlement to equitable relief.

**Lesson:** "Confirms" framing works best when opponent's admissions directly satisfy elements you need to prove. Contract execution ≠ breach ≠ entitlement to injunction.

**3. Failed to Deliver on Conditions Precedent**
Resolution granting 49% equity was conditional on:
- Providing "viable lease"
- Providing $500,000 funding

Plaintiff argued the lease was "viable at that time" and landlord's $650K tenant improvement commitment satisfied funding requirement. Court rejected this:
- Lease never became binding (conditions failed)
- $650K tenant improvement was contingent benefit, not actual capital
- "None of that money ever made it into the company"

**Lesson:** Before seeking injunctive relief, ensure conditions precedent are actually satisfied with documentary proof of actual delivery, not just contingent commitments.

**4. "Trade Secret" Failed on Public Availability**
Property location had "for rent" signs since August 2022—over a year before NDA:
> Defense: "The availability of this property was as confidential as the billboards in Times Square."

NDA defined confidential information to exclude "anything which is publicly known or becomes publicly known"—defense successfully invoked this carve-out.

**Lesson:** Before claiming confidential information/trade secret, verify information wasn't publicly available. Google Street View, broker listings, and advertisements are easy evidence for opponents.

**5. Court Skepticism from Opening Questions**
Court's skeptical questions during plaintiff's argument signaled problems:
- "There's red tape speaking to a landlord?"
- "Have you walked around this neighborhood?"
- "Do you not see a lawsuit coming up from the landlord?"

**Lesson:** Anticipate and address obvious weaknesses. If your theory requires explaining why ordinary conduct was actually wrongful, prepare for skepticism.

**6. Reputational Harm Claims Were Too Speculative**
Reply Affirmation argued:
> "Allowing Qube to open without NAP IV would severely harm NAP IV's reputation... Failure to grant relief will inflict permanent damage on NAP IV's reputation, making recovery unlikely."

Court did not credit these speculative, conclusory claims about potential future investor relationships.

**Lesson:** Reputational harm must be concrete and documented—not speculative predictions about how investors might react.

**7. Ignored Massive Asymmetric Harm to Defendants**
Defendants had:
- $420K security deposit at risk
- $70K/month rent obligations
- $1.26M personal guarantee (individual defendants)
- State cannabis license at stake
- Potential personal bankruptcy

Plaintiff's brief did not adequately address this asymmetric harm or explain why their interest outweighed these concrete losses.

**Lesson:** Anticipate and address the harm your requested injunction will cause to defendants. If you can't explain why your harm exceeds their harm, expect to lose on balance of equities.

**Court's Skeptical View of the Motion:**
Court at oral argument asked plaintiff's counsel:
> "So your clients would rather see defendant just not open anything or not make a deal without your client?"

This framing—as seeking to destroy defendant's business—was fatal.

**Lesson:** Frame relief as preserving status quo, not as punishing defendants. "Don't open your business" is a harder sell than "honor your contractual obligations."

**What This Case Teaches About OSC Practice:**
1. Balance of equities is often decisive—address it thoroughly
2. Contractual acknowledgments don't substitute for actual proof
3. Public availability destroys confidentiality claims
4. Quantifiable harm = compensable harm = no injunction
5. Address defendant's harm head-on—ignoring it won't make it disappear
6. Speculation about future harm won't satisfy irreparable injury requirement
7. Conditions precedent must be actually satisfied, not just claimed
