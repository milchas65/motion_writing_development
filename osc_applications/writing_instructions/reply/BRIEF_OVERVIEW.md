# Reply Brief Instructions - OSC Opposition

## Purpose

Provide guidance for drafting reply briefs in support of opposition to Orders to Show Cause seeking preliminary injunctive relief.

## When Reply Briefs Are Filed

Reply briefs may be filed when:
- Movant files a reply in support of their OSC application
- Court permits sur-reply briefing
- New arguments or evidence require response

## Key Principles

### 1. Reply Scope Is Limited
A reply brief should:
- Respond to arguments raised in movant's reply/response
- Address new evidence submitted
- Clarify mischaracterizations of your position
- NOT raise entirely new arguments (preserve for later)

### 2. Focus on Movant's Weaknesses
Use the reply to highlight:
- Arguments movant failed to address
- Evidence movant cannot refute
- Concessions in movant's papers
- Inconsistencies in movant's position

### 3. Reinforce Your Strongest Points
- Lead with your winning arguments
- Show movant's response is inadequate
- Keep the focus on why injunction should be denied

## Structure

### Short and Focused
Reply briefs should be significantly shorter than the main opposition:
- 5-10 pages typically sufficient
- Address only matters requiring response
- Avoid rehashing arguments already made

### Organization Options

**Option A: Point-by-Point Response**
```
REPLY ARGUMENT

I. MOVANT'S REPLY FAILS TO SALVAGE ITS LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ARGUMENT

II. MOVANT CANNOT DEMONSTRATE IRREPARABLE HARM

III. THE BALANCE OF EQUITIES REMAINS IN RESPONDENT'S FAVOR
```

**Option B: Issue-Focused**
```
REPLY ARGUMENT

I. MOVANT CONCEDES [KEY POINT]

II. MOVANT'S NEW ARGUMENTS FAIL

III. MOVANT'S NEW EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT
```

**Option C: Numbered Response to Opponent's Arguments**
Based on Bangladesh Bank Doc 472:
```
REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
[1-2 paragraphs framing reply]

I. [RESPONSE TO OPPONENT'S FIRST ARGUMENT]

II. [RESPONSE TO OPPONENT'S SECOND ARGUMENT]

III. [RESPONSE TO OPPONENT'S THIRD ARGUMENT]

CONCLUSION
```

This structure demolishes each of opponent's arguments in turn with Roman numeral organization.

## Effective Reply Techniques

### Highlight Concessions
When movant drops or modifies an argument:

> Notably absent from Movant's reply is any response to [Respondent's] argument that [key point]. This silence speaks volumes. Movant has effectively conceded that [conclusion favorable to respondent].

### Attack New Arguments
If movant raises arguments for the first time in reply:

> Movant raises [argument] for the first time in its reply. This argument is both waived and meritless. Arguments raised for the first time in reply papers are not properly before the Court. *See [cite]*. Even if considered, the argument fails because [brief explanation].

### Address New Evidence
If movant submits new evidence:

> Movant's belated submission of [evidence] does not change the analysis. First, [Respondent] had no opportunity to respond to this evidence. Second, even if credited, the evidence [fails to establish X / is contradicted by Y / is insufficient because Z].

### Reframe the Dispute
Keep focus on the big picture:

> Movant's reply obscures the central issue: [restate your strongest framing]. Despite pages of briefing, Movant still cannot show [key deficiency]. The motion should be denied.

### Attack Missing Personal Affidavit
Based on Bangladesh Bank Doc 472 - one of the most powerful reply techniques:

When opponent submits only attorney affirmation without personal affidavit from knowledgeable party:

> Notably absent from [Party's] opposition is any personal affidavit from [the individual with actual knowledge]. [Party] offers only the affirmation of its counsel, who has no personal knowledge of the relevant facts. An attorney's affirmation, standing alone, constitutes nothing more than attorney argument and is entitled to no evidentiary weight.

**Why this is powerful:**
- Highlights evidentiary gap
- Undermines opponent's factual assertions
- Attorney can only affirm what they are told—no personal knowledge
- Court may order personal affidavit as relief (see Bangladesh Bank Doc 480)

### Incredulity Language
Based on Bangladesh Bank Doc 472:

Effective language for attacking opponent's implausible claims:
- "incredible" — the claim defies belief
- "strains credulity" — the explanation is implausible
- "cannot explain away" — the evidence speaks for itself
- "defies common sense" — no reasonable person would accept this

**Example:**
> [Party's] claim that it conducted a thorough search strains credulity. [Party] cannot explain away the complete absence of [obviously relevant documents]. It is incredible that [implausible assertion].

### Attack Conclusory Assertions
Based on Bangladesh Bank Doc 472:

When opponent's papers lack factual support:

> [Party's] assertion that [claim] is entirely conclusory. [Party] offers no documents, no affidavit from a person with knowledge, and no explanation for [gap]. Conclusory assertions are insufficient to defeat [Movant's] showing.

**Key phrases:**
- "conclusory" — lacking factual support
- "unsupported" — no evidence offered
- "fails to address" — ignores the point entirely
- "bald assertion" — claim without foundation

### Point Out Non-Responses
Catalog arguments movant failed to address:

> Movant's reply is notable for what it does not say. Movant offers no response to [Respondent's] showing that:
> - [Unaddressed point 1]
> - [Unaddressed point 2]
> - [Unaddressed point 3]
>
> These unrebutted points compel denial of the application.

## OSC-Specific Reply Issues

### Delay Rebuttal
If movant tries to explain delay:

> Movant's attempt to explain its [X-week/month] delay fails. Movant claims it was [excuse], but this ignores that [counter-evidence]. The delay remains fatal to Movant's claim of irreparable harm.

### Irreparable Harm Rebuttal
If movant tries to show harm is not monetary:

> Movant's reply confirms that its alleged harm is fundamentally economic. Movant now claims damages of $[amount], which proves the point: this is precisely the kind of harm compensable in money damages. If Movant prevails at trial, it can recover these sums.

### Bond Discussion
If movant objects to bond amount:

> Movant's objection to the proposed bond amount is unavailing. [Respondent] has documented potential damages of $[amount]. Movant offers no contrary evidence. The requested bond is appropriate and, if anything, conservative.

## Tone

### Confident but Professional
- "Movant's response only confirms..."
- "Far from salvaging its position, Movant..."
- "Movant's arguments are unavailing..."
- "The reply underscores why relief should be denied..."

### Avoid
- Personal attacks on counsel
- Excessive sarcasm
- Repetition of entire arguments from main brief
- New arguments that should have been in main brief

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too long** - Reply briefs should be focused and concise
2. **Raising new arguments** - Save for later proceedings
3. **Rehashing main brief** - Only address what requires response
4. **Missing concessions** - Highlight what movant dropped
5. **Ignoring new evidence** - Must address new submissions
6. **Weak conclusion** - End with clear request for denial

## Sample Reply Opening

> Movant's reply confirms what the opposition demonstrated: Movant cannot satisfy its burden for preliminary injunctive relief.
>
> Despite [X] pages of additional briefing, Movant still fails to address [Respondent's] showing that: (1) the alleged harm is compensable in money damages; (2) Movant's [X-week] delay belies any claim of urgency; and (3) the balance of equities tips sharply against injunctive relief.
>
> Movant's reply raises [X] new arguments, each of which fails. [Brief preview]. The application should be denied.

## Sample Reply Conclusion

> For the foregoing reasons, and those set forth in [Respondent's] opposition, Movant's application for a preliminary injunction should be denied.
>
> Should the Court grant any relief, [Respondent] respectfully requests that Movant be required to post a bond of at least $[amount] and that any injunction be narrowly limited to [scope].
