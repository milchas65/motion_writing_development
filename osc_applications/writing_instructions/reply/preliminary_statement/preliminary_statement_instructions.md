```

## Content Elements

### Highlight Admissions

- Concessions supporting injunction elements

### Rebut Defenses
- Address claimed lack of success
- Rebut irreparable harm arguments
- Counter balance of equities claims

## Example

> Defendant's opposition confirms the core facts: Defendant has Plaintiff's confidential information and intends to share it with competitors. Defendant's legal defenses fail.
>
> First, Defendant's contract interpretation is wrong—the confidentiality clause plainly prohibits the contemplated disclosure. Second, Defendant's claim that damages are adequate ignores that trade secrets, once disclosed, lose their value permanently. Third, Defendant offers no evidence of harm from maintaining the status quo.
