# Argument Instructions - OSC Opposition

## Purpose

Demonstrate that movant fails to satisfy one or more of the required factors for preliminary injunctive relief.

## Overall Structure

Organize arguments by preliminary injunction factor. Attack each factor independently - defeating ANY factor defeats the motion.

```

## Point I: Attacking Likelihood of Success

### The Standard
- Movant must show "probability" of success, not mere possibility
- Substantive defenses defeat this showing
- Disputed facts preclude summary determination

### Attack Strategies

**A. Substantive Defenses**
Raise defenses that show movant is unlikely to prevail:
- Statute of limitations
- Lack of standing / capacity to sue
- Failure to satisfy elements of claim
- Contractual defenses (waiver, estoppel, release)
- Affirmative defenses

Example (Statute of Limitations):
> Movant cannot demonstrate likelihood of success because the claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The alleged breach occurred in [year], but this action was not commenced until [year] - well beyond the [X]-year limitations period. (Cite statute and cases.)

Example (Standing/Capacity):
> Movant cannot demonstrate likelihood of success because it lacks standing to bring this action. [Describe capacity defect: corporate dissolution, lack of assignment, failure to satisfy standing requirements]. Contrary to Movant's sworn statements, [describe factual basis defeating standing]. A party that lacks standing cannot satisfy the threshold requirement of likelihood of success on the merits. *See Terrell v. Terrell*, 279 A.D.2d 301, 303 (1st Dep't 2001).

**B. Factual Disputes**
Show that genuine factual disputes preclude finding likelihood of success:

> The parties' competing affidavits demonstrate disputed issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on this motion. Whether Defendant breached the agreement - the central issue - is hotly contested. This Court cannot make such factual determinations on a preliminary injunction motion.

**C. Legal Deficiencies**
Attack the legal basis for movant's claims:

> Even accepting Movant's facts, the claims fail as a matter of law because [legal deficiency]. Movant's theory requires [X], but New York law is clear that [Y]. (Cite cases.)

**D. Movant's Own Evidence Is Insufficient**
Point to gaps or weaknesses in movant's evidentiary showing:

> Movant's papers are notably silent on [key element]. The affidavit of [name] fails to establish [required showing]. This evidentiary gap is fatal to Movant's application.

## Point II: Attacking Irreparable Harm

### The Standard
Irreparable harm must be:
- **Actual and imminent** - not speculative or remote
- **Not compensable in money damages** - the key inquiry
- **Certain to occur** - not merely possible

### Attack Strategies

**A. Harm Is Compensable in Money Damages**
The most common and effective attack:

> The harm Movant alleges - lost profits and business disruption - is quintessentially compensable in money damages. "Where money damages are adequate compensation, a preliminary injunction should not issue." *JSG Trading Corp. v. Tray-Wrap, Inc.*, 917 F.2d 75, 79 (2d Cir. 1990).

Categories of compensable harm:
- Lost profits
- Lost business opportunities
- Economic losses
- Contract damages
- Quantifiable financial injury

**B. Harm Is Speculative/Conjectural**
Attack speculation about future harm:

> Movant's claimed harm rests on speculation about what "might" happen. But "speculative injury does not constitute irreparable harm." *Int'l Dairy Foods Ass'n v. Amestoy*, 92 F.3d 67, 71 (2d Cir. 1996). Movant cannot obtain a preliminary injunction based on "fears of what might happen." *Id.*

Red flags indicating speculation:
- "May" or "might" suffer harm
- "Could" result in injury
- "Fears" or "concerns" about future events
- Lack of concrete evidence of actual harm

**C. Delay in Seeking Relief Negates Irreparable Harm**
Movant's delay undercuts urgency:

> Movant's delay in seeking relief belies any claim of irreparable harm. The conduct Movant complains of began in [month/year], yet Movant waited until [month/year] - [X] months - to seek emergency relief. "A party's failure to act with speed or urgency in moving for a preliminary injunction necessarily undermines a finding of irreparable harm." *Citibank, N.A. v. Citytrust*, 756 F.2d 273, 276 (2d Cir. 1985).

Calculate and emphasize the delay period. Even weeks of delay can be significant.

**D. Harm Is Self-Inflicted**
Movant caused its own problems:

> The harm Movant claims is of its own making. Having [describe movant's conduct], Movant cannot now claim irreparable injury from the natural consequences of its own choices. Equity does not reward those who create their own emergencies.

**E. Movant Can Be Made Whole at Trial**
Adequate remedy at law:

> Even if Movant suffers some harm, a damages award after trial will make Movant whole. This is precisely the kind of harm for which the legal system provides an adequate remedy - money damages. Preliminary injunctive relief is reserved for situations where legal remedies are inadequate, which is not the case here.

**F. Quantify Harm to Show Compensability**
Use specific dollar amounts to demonstrate harm is monetary and calculable:

> Movant's own papers reveal the monetary nature of the alleged harm. Movant claims damages of $[X] in lost [revenue/profits/payments]. These figures confirm that Movant's injury is precisely the kind of quantifiable economic loss for which money damages provide an adequate remedy.

Technique: When respondent's conduct has caused specific, documented losses, cite those amounts to show the harm is calculable and therefore compensable in money damages.

## Point III: Balance of Equities

### The Standard
- Compare harm to movant if injunction denied vs. harm to respondent if granted
- Balance must "tip decidedly" in movant's favor
- Consider hardship to third parties and public interest

### Attack Strategies

**A. Harm to Respondent Outweighs Harm to Movant**
Show injunction would cause greater harm to your client:

> The balance of equities tips sharply against injunctive relief. Granting the injunction would [describe harm to respondent: shut down business, terminate employees, breach other contracts, cause financial ruin]. By contrast, denying the injunction leaves Movant with [describe movant's situation: monetary claim, ability to seek damages]. The potential harm to [Respondent] far exceeds any harm to Movant.

**A-1. Asymmetric Harm Analysis**
Show that respondent's harm is irreparable while movant's is compensable:

> A Court is required "to look to the relative prejudice to each party accruing from a grant or a denial of the requested relief." *Ma v. Lien*, 198 A.D.2d 186, 186-87 (1st Dep't 1993). If the Court denies the injunction and [Respondent] ultimately prevails, [Respondent's] damages can be fully compensated by a money judgment against Movant, a solvent [entity/individual]. However, if the Court grants the injunction and [Respondent] ultimately prevails, [Respondent] will have no recourse because [describe why harm is unrecoverable: movant's insolvency, dissolved entity, judgment-proof party]. This asymmetry compels denial.

Key technique: Demonstrate that movant can be made whole through money damages if it prevails at trial, while respondent cannot recover if wrongfully enjoined.

**B. Maintaining Status Quo Favors Respondent**
Define status quo to favor your client:

> The true status quo - the "last actual, peaceable, uncontested status existing between the parties" - is [describe situation favoring client]. Movant seeks not to preserve the status quo, but to alter it in its favor. Such mandatory relief requires an even higher showing, which Movant cannot make.

**C. Unclean Hands**
Movant's own misconduct bars equitable relief:

> Movant comes to this Court with unclean hands. It is well-settled that "he who comes into equity must come with clean hands." *Weiss v. Mayflower Doughnut Corp.*, 1 N.Y.2d 310, 316 (1956). Here, Movant [describe misconduct: breached the agreement first, engaged in fraud, violated duties]. A party whose own conduct caused the dispute cannot obtain equitable relief.

Types of unclean hands conduct:
- Breaching the agreement first
- Engaging in fraud or misrepresentation
- Violating fiduciary or contractual duties
- Diverting funds or self-dealing
- **Misrepresentation to the Court** - particularly powerful:

> The balance of equities tips heavily against Movant because Movant [misrepresented material facts / made false sworn statements] to the Court for the purpose of obtaining the relief it now seeks. A party that obtains equitable relief through misrepresentation is not entitled to retain that relief.

**D. Laches**
Delay bars equitable relief:

> Movant's unreasonable delay in seeking relief constitutes laches. Movant knew of the complained-of conduct since [date] but waited [duration] to seek injunctive relief. This delay, coupled with prejudice to Respondent [describe prejudice], bars the requested relief.

**E. Public Interest / Third Party Harm**
Broader considerations weigh against relief:

> The public interest weighs against injunctive relief. Granting the injunction would [describe public harm: affect consumers, disrupt industry, harm employees]. Courts must consider these broader consequences when exercising equitable discretion.

## Point IV: Bond Requirements

### Always Address the Bond
Even if arguing the motion should be denied, address bond:

> Should this Court grant any injunctive relief, it should require Movant to post a substantial bond. CPLR 6312(b) [or Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c)] requires the movant to post an undertaking "in an amount to be fixed by the court" to compensate the enjoined party for damages sustained if the injunction was wrongfully granted.

> Here, [Respondent] would suffer damages of at least $[amount] if wrongfully enjoined, including [list: lost profits, operational costs, legal fees]. Accordingly, any injunction should be conditioned on Movant posting a bond of no less than $[amount].

### Bond as Litigation Strategy
- A high bond requirement may deter movant
- Forces movant to quantify their confidence
- Protects client if injunction later reversed

## Advanced Techniques

### Flip the Irreparable Harm
Show YOUR client will suffer irreparable harm if injunction issues:

> Indeed, it is [Respondent] - not Movant - who faces irreparable harm. If the injunction issues, [Respondent] will [describe irreparable harm to your client]. This harm cannot be undone by any subsequent proceeding.

### Attack Movant's Evidence
Challenge the sufficiency of movant's evidentiary showing:

> Movant's papers are long on rhetoric but short on evidence. The affidavit of [name] is conclusory and lacks factual foundation. Movant submits no documentary evidence supporting [key claim]. This Court should not grant extraordinary relief based on such a thin record.

### Request Evidentiary Hearing
If facts are disputed:

> At minimum, this Court should conduct an evidentiary hearing before ruling. The parties' competing affidavits present disputed issues of fact that cannot be resolved on papers alone. [Respondent] is entitled to cross-examine Movant's affiants before this Court makes any credibility determinations.

### Prior Testimony Impeachment
Based on Bangladesh Bank Doc 472:

Use opponent's prior sworn statements to contradict current position:

> [Party's] current assertion that [claim] is contradicted by [Party's] own prior testimony. In [prior proceeding/deposition], [Party's witness] testified under oath that [contrary statement]. [Party] cannot now take the opposite position.

**Sources for impeachment:**
- Deposition transcripts
- Prior affidavits in same or related case
- Prior hearing testimony
- Discovery responses (interrogatory answers, RFAs)

### Privilege Workaround Strategy
Based on Bangladesh Bank Doc 460:

When privilege blocks direct discovery, seek alternative sources:

> While [Party] has asserted privilege over [direct communications], Plaintiff is entitled to discover the underlying [documents/communications] that may reveal the same information. [Party] cannot use privilege as both a sword and shield.

**Alternative discovery paths:**
- Communications with non-privileged parties about same subject
- Business records reflecting privileged communications
- Third-party documents referencing privileged matters
- Metadata and file information

### Attack Missing Personal Affidavit
Based on Bangladesh Bank Docs 472, 480:

When opponent relies solely on attorney affirmation:

> [Party's] opposition is fatally deficient because it lacks any personal affidavit from [the individual with knowledge]. [Party's] counsel's affirmation is entitled to no evidentiary weight because an attorney has no personal knowledge of the underlying facts. The Court should require [Party] to submit a personal affidavit from [appropriate person] detailing [specific information].

**This technique was validated in Bangladesh Bank Doc 480** — the court ordered defendant to submit a personal affidavit from a party representative detailing search efforts.

### Narrow the Injunction
If injunction seems likely, argue for limitations:

> Should the Court be inclined to grant any relief, [Respondent] respectfully requests that any injunction be narrowly tailored to [describe limited scope]. The broad relief Movant seeks is unnecessary to address the claimed harm and would impose undue burden on [Respondent].

## Length

- 8-15 pages for substantive OSC opposition
- Allocate space based on strength of arguments
- Irreparable harm and balance of equities often most winnable

## Common Mistakes

1. **Conceding likelihood of success** - Even if merits favor movant, argue the standard is demanding
2. **Ignoring the money damages point** - Almost always argue harm is compensable
3. **Failing to calculate delay** - Specific delay periods are powerful
4. **Weak bond argument** - Always quantify potential damages
5. **Missing equitable defenses** - Unclean hands and laches are often available
6. **Over-focusing on one factor** - Attack ALL factors to maximize chances of success

## INSIGHTS FROM REVIEWED PACKAGES

### NAP IV v. QUBE USA LLC (Index 651937/2024)
**Opposition SUCCESSFUL:** Motion for TRO/preliminary injunction DENIED based on balance of equities.

**Case Context:** Plaintiff sought to enjoin defendants from opening cannabis dispensary at leased Times Square location, claiming breach of NDA/non-circumvent agreement and 49% equity interest.

**Winning Defense Arguments:**

**1. "Money Is Not Irreparable Harm"**
Direct, declarative statement at oral argument:
> "To the extent that STS is entitled to anything, they can absolutely be compensated for their efforts by money damages. You heard Mr. Landau say there's a lot of money in these dispensaries, there's money, money, money. Well, money is not irreparable harm by definition."

**Key technique:** Turn movant's own arguments about the value of the opportunity against them—the more valuable movant says it is, the more quantifiable (and therefore compensable) the harm.

**2. Conditions Precedent Defense**
Resolution granting equity was conditional on two things:
- Delivery of viable lease
- Funding of at least $500,000

Neither condition was met. The resolution's "whereas" clause (past tense) did not satisfy conditions—the operative language required actual delivery.

> "The resolution... is unequivocal in that it says that to the extent that STS is entitled to any interest in the company it is conditional on two things: One, the delivery of a viable lease, and, two, funding of at least $500,000. Neither of those conditions were met."

**3. Public Availability Defeats Confidentiality Claims**
Destroyed trade secret/confidential information argument by showing public availability:
> "The availability of this property was as confidential as the billboards in Times Square. It was in no way confidential... if your Honor is so inclined, you can Google the address, 1412 Broadway. In Google Street View from August of 2022, more than a year before all of this happened, it has those same for rent signs in the window."

**Key technique:** Point to publicly available evidence (advertisements, Google Street View, broker listings) to defeat confidentiality claims.

**4. Quantify Catastrophic Harm to Defendants**
Specific dollar amounts showing defendants' exposure:
- $420,000 security deposit already paid
- $70,000/month rent obligation
- $1.26 million personal guarantee from individual defendants
- Risk of personal bankruptcy

> "Any TRO which interrupts their ability to get this license open essentially renders the license worthless, triggers a default under the lease, and in all likelihood... risks putting two CAURD social equity licensees into personal bankruptcy because they will be on the hook personally for over a million dollars of rent with no revenues to pay that rent."

**5. Self-Defeating Argument**
Show that injunction harms the very interest movant claims:
> "Even if STS were entitled to its 49 percent, which they are not, but hypothetically let me grant Mr. Landau the benefit of the doubt, the injunction is destroying the value of the company which they claim to own. So it makes no sense."

**6. Policy/Public Interest Alignment**
Tied defense to state policy goals (MRTA social equity program):
> "[T]he consequences of this extraordinary request for injunctive relief would be catastrophic for my clients, and for the license, and for the state legal cannabis program that they are one of the few bright spots, one of the few social equity licensees to get to a point where they are now building out their space."

**7. Standing/Authority Attack**
Challenged movant's ability to seek the relief requested:
> "STS is not the owner of the property. STS has no standing to usurp the lease that the owner of the property signed with my client. They have no right in the property. They have no ability to do that on behalf of the landlord. They didn't name the landlord in this lawsuit."

**Court's Ruling:**
> "The motion for the TRO is denied simply just even based on balance of equities. The balance of equities does not lie with plaintiff, and I'm just going to leave it at that."

**What This Teaches:**
1. Balance of equities can be dispositive—win there even if other factors are close
2. Quantify defendant's harm with specific dollar amounts
3. Personal guarantee liability is powerful (bankruptcy risk)
4. Turn movant's characterizations against them
5. Policy alignment adds persuasive weight
6. Public availability evidence destroys confidentiality claims
