# Emergency Relief Instructions - OSC Opposition

## Purpose

Provide specific guidance for opposing TROs and emergency preliminary injunction applications, including strategies for deflating manufactured urgency and handling expedited timelines.

## TRO vs. Preliminary Injunction

| Aspect | TRO | Preliminary Injunction |
|--------|-----|------------------------|
| **Duration** | Limited (typically 14 days federal, varies state) | Until trial/final judgment |
| **Standard** | Higher - immediate, irreparable harm | Standard PI factors |
| **Notice** | May be ex parte in emergencies | Requires notice |
| **Bond** | Required | Required |
| **Purpose** | Preserve status quo until hearing | Preserve status quo until trial |

## Deflating Manufactured Urgency

### The Delay Attack

The most powerful tool against claimed urgency is demonstrating movant's own delay:

**Calculate the Delay:**
- When did movant first learn of the complained-of conduct?
- When did movant file this application?
- How many days/weeks/months elapsed?

**Frame the Argument:**
> Movant claims this matter is urgent, yet the facts tell a different story. The conduct Movant now characterizes as requiring "emergency" relief began on [date]. Despite this, Movant waited [X days/weeks/months] before seeking relief from this Court. If the matter were truly urgent, Movant would not have delayed. This delay is fatal to any claim of emergency.

**Key Cases on Delay:**
- *Citibank, N.A. v. Citytrust*, 756 F.2d 273, 276 (2d Cir. 1985): "A party's failure to act with speed or urgency in moving for a preliminary injunction necessarily undermines a finding of irreparable harm."
- *Tough Traveler, Ltd. v. Outbound Prods.*, 60 F.3d 964, 968 (2d Cir. 1995): Delay of ten weeks undermined irreparable harm claim.

### Self-Created Emergency

When movant's own actions caused the situation:

> The so-called "emergency" is entirely of Movant's own making. Having [describe movant's conduct that created the situation], Movant now seeks emergency relief to escape the consequences of its own choices. Equity does not reward parties who manufacture their own crises.

### No True Change in Circumstances

Question whether anything has actually changed:

> Movant offers no explanation for why this application is being filed now. The circumstances Movant complains of have existed since [date]. Nothing has changed to create an emergency. Movant's belated attempt to characterize this as urgent should be rejected.

### Business as Usual

Show operations continue normally:

> Movant's actions belie any claim of emergency. Since the alleged [wrongful conduct], Movant has continued to [conduct business normally, not sought alternative relief, not taken protective measures]. If Movant truly faced imminent, irreparable harm, one would expect to see [describe expected emergency behavior]. The absence of any such urgency in Movant's own conduct speaks louder than the rhetoric in its papers.

## Opposing Ex Parte TROs

### Notice Requirements

If movant sought or obtained ex parte relief improperly:

**Federal Rule 65(b):**
> An ex parte TRO may issue only if "specific facts in an affidavit or a verified complaint clearly show that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition."

**Attack Improper Ex Parte Relief:**
> Movant failed to satisfy the stringent requirements for ex parte relief. There was no showing that [Respondent] could not be heard before ruling. Indeed, Movant made no effort to provide notice despite having [describe: days to prepare papers, knowledge of respondent's counsel, etc.]. The ex parte TRO should be vacated.

### Request Immediate Hearing
> [Respondent] respectfully requests an immediate hearing on this application. [Respondent] was denied the opportunity to be heard before the ex parte TRO issued and is entitled to a prompt hearing to present its opposition.

## Handling Expedited Timelines

### Request Adequate Time to Respond

When faced with unreasonably short deadlines:

> [Respondent] respectfully requests additional time to respond to this application. The [X]-day return date does not provide adequate time to investigate the allegations, gather evidence, and prepare a proper response. The complexity of the issues and volume of materials require [reasonable time period]. Movant will not be prejudiced by a brief extension, as [describe why brief delay is acceptable].

### Preserve Issues for Later

When time is too short for full response:

> Due to the truncated timeline, [Respondent] reserves the right to supplement this opposition and raises the following additional defenses without full briefing: [list issues]. [Respondent] will address these matters more fully at the hearing or in supplemental papers.

## TRO-Specific Arguments

### "Immediate" Means Immediate

For TROs, harm must be immediate, not eventual:

> A TRO requires a showing of "immediate" harm - harm that will occur before a preliminary injunction hearing can be held. Movant's alleged harm - [describe] - is not immediate. It is, at most, a concern about potential future injury. This does not satisfy the heightened standard for a TRO.

### Adequacy of Preliminary Injunction Process

Argue the normal process is sufficient:

> The ordinary preliminary injunction process provides Movant adequate protection. If Movant's claims have merit, a preliminary injunction can issue after proper briefing and argument. There is no need for the extraordinary remedy of a TRO. The alleged harm Movant fears will not occur in the brief period before a preliminary injunction hearing.

## Bond Arguments for Emergency Relief

### Higher Bond for TROs

> If the Court grants any TRO, it should require a substantial bond. The harm to [Respondent] from an improvidently granted TRO would be significant: [quantify damages]. Given the expedited nature of this proceeding and the lack of opportunity for full briefing, a higher bond is warranted to protect [Respondent] if the TRO is later found to have been improvidently granted.

### Bond as Check on Frivolous Applications

> The bond requirement serves as a check on frivolous or ill-considered applications for emergency relief. Movant should be required to back its claims of urgency with a meaningful undertaking. If Movant is confident in its position, posting a substantial bond should not be problematic.

## Procedural Objections

### Defective Papers
- Missing required affidavits
- Failure to verify complaint (if required)
- Improper service of OSC
- Failure to comply with local rules

### Improper Relief Sought
- Relief sought exceeds scope of complaint
- TRO would effectively grant final judgment
- Mandatory injunction improperly characterized as prohibitory

### Jurisdictional Issues
- Lack of personal jurisdiction over respondent
- Forum selection clause requires different venue
- Arbitration clause requires stay

## Sample Preliminary Statement - Emergency Opposition

> Movant's application for a TRO should be denied. Despite characterizing this as an "emergency," Movant waited [X weeks/months] after learning of the complained-of conduct before seeking relief. This delay alone defeats any claim of imminent, irreparable harm.
>
> On the merits, Movant cannot satisfy any of the required factors for injunctive relief. First, Movant is unlikely to succeed because [brief statement]. Second, the alleged harm - [describe] - is compensable in money damages and thus not irreparable. Third, the balance of equities favors [Respondent], who would suffer [describe harm] if the TRO issues.
>
> Movant's request for emergency relief is an attempt to gain tactical advantage in ordinary commercial litigation. This Court should decline to grant such extraordinary relief on such a thin showing.

## Hearing Preparation Notes

### Key Points for Oral Argument
1. Lead with delay - it's often the strongest point
2. Have specific dates ready (when movant learned, when filed)
3. Quantify damages to support bond request
4. Be prepared to discuss scope limitations if court inclined to grant

### Evidence to Prepare
- Timeline showing movant's delay
- Evidence of movant's continued normal operations
- Quantification of damages for bond
- Evidence supporting affirmative defenses

## Common Mistakes

1. **Accepting the "emergency" frame** - Always challenge the urgency
2. **Not calculating delay precisely** - Days and weeks matter
3. **Insufficient bond argument** - Quantify specific damages
4. **Failing to request hearing** - Especially for ex parte TROs
5. **Missing procedural defects** - Check papers carefully for deficiencies
