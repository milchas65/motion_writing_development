# Legal Standard Instructions - OSC Opposition

## Purpose

Establish the legal framework governing preliminary injunctive relief. Frame the standard to emphasize the movant's heavy burden and the extraordinary nature of the requested relief.

## Structure

### Opening Paragraph
State that preliminary injunctive relief is an extraordinary remedy:
- "A preliminary injunction is a drastic remedy that should not be granted unless the movant clearly demonstrates entitlement to such relief."
- Cite the controlling standard from your jurisdiction.

### The Core Standard

**New York State:**
> "A party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) irreparable injury absent a preliminary injunction, and (3) a balance of the equities in its favor."
> -- *Nobu Next Door, LLC v. Fine Arts Hous., Inc.*, 4 N.Y.3d 839, 840 (2005)

**Federal (Second Circuit):**
> "A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest."
> -- *Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council*, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)

### Emphasize the Burden

Key points to stress:

1. **Extraordinary Remedy**
   - Preliminary injunctions are "drastic" remedies
   - Granted only in "unusual circumstances"
   - Courts are "reluctant" to grant such relief
   - *Cit.: Doe v. Axelrod*, 73 N.Y.2d 748, 750 (1988)

2. **Movant's Heavy Burden**
   - Movant bears the burden on ALL factors
   - Failure on ANY factor warrants denial
   - "Clear showing" required
   - *Cit.: Mazurek v. Armstrong*, 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)

3. **All Factors Must Be Satisfied**
   - Unlike MTD (where any cognizable theory suffices)
   - Movant must satisfy EACH element
   - Court has NO discretion if any factor fails

4. **Not a Trial on the Merits**
   - Preliminary determination only
   - Does not resolve ultimate issues
   - But movant must still show likelihood of success

### What Movant Must Show for Each Factor

**Likelihood of Success:**
- More than "possible" success
- Must show "probability" of prevailing
- Cannot rest on conclusory allegations
- Substantive defenses defeat this factor

**Irreparable Harm:**
- Harm must be "actual and imminent"
- Not "remote or speculative"
- Cannot be compensable in money damages
- Delay in seeking relief undercuts this showing

**Balance of Equities:**
- Hardship to movant vs. hardship to respondent
- Must show balance "tips decidedly" in movant's favor
- Equitable defenses (unclean hands, laches) considered
- Public interest may be relevant

### Status Quo Preservation

Emphasize that the purpose of injunctive relief is to preserve the status quo:

> "The purpose of a preliminary injunction is to maintain the status quo pending resolution of the underlying action."

When movant seeks to CHANGE the status quo:
- Higher burden applies
- Movant must show "clear" or "substantial" likelihood of success
- Such "mandatory" injunctions are disfavored

### TRO-Specific Standards (if applicable)

If opposing a TRO:
- Even more stringent standard
- Requires showing of "immediate and irreparable injury"
- Ex parte TROs require additional showing re: notice
- CPLR 6313 (NY) / Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b) requirements

## Length

1-2 pages. Establish the framework thoroughly but save detailed argument for the Argument section.

## Common Mistakes

- Understating the burden (it's "heavy," not just "must show")
- Failing to emphasize ALL factors must be satisfied
- Not distinguishing mandatory vs. prohibitory injunctions
- Omitting bond discussion
- Using MTD language instead of PI language
