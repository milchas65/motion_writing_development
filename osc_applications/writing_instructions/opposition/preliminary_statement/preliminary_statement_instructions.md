PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

[Opening: State that the application should be denied]

[Body: Preview failures on each element]

[Closing: Note procedural or equitable concerns]
```

## Content Elements

### Opening
> [Movant's] application for injunctive relief should be denied. [Movant] has failed to satisfy the demanding standard for this extraordinary remedy.

### Attack Each Element
Address each prong of the preliminary injunction standard:

1. **No Likelihood of Success:**
> [Movant] cannot demonstrate likelihood of success because [preview defense].

2. **No Irreparable Harm:**
> [Movant's] alleged harm is [speculative / compensable by money damages / self-inflicted].

3. **Balance of Equities Favors Opposition:**
> Granting injunctive relief would [harm to defendant / third parties] while [movant's alleged harm is minimal / speculative].

### Additional Defenses
- Laches / unclean hands
- Adequate remedy at law
- Overbreadth of requested relief

## Example

> Plaintiff's application for a preliminary injunction should be denied. Plaintiff cannot satisfy any element of the demanding standard for this extraordinary remedy.
>
> First, Plaintiff is unlikely to succeed on its breach of contract claim because the Agreement expressly permits the conduct Plaintiff seeks to enjoin. Second, Plaintiff alleges only economic harm, which is compensable by money damages and cannot support injunctive relief. Third, the balance of equities favors Defendant—an injunction would shut down Defendant's business operations affecting hundreds of employees.
>
> Moreover, Plaintiff waited six months after learning of Defendant's conduct before seeking "emergency" relief. This delay undercuts any claim of imminent irreparable harm.

## Tone
- Confident but measured
- Address the emergency claim directly
- Focus on legal deficiencies
