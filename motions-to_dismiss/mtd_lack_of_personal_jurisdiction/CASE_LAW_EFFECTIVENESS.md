## CONSENT-BY-REGISTRATION CASES (Post-Daimler)

| Case | Citation | Key Quote | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp.** | 814 F.3d 619 (2d Cir. 2016) | "If mere registration... sufficed to confer general jurisdiction by implicit consent, every corporation would be subject to general jurisdiction in every state in which it registered, and Daimler's ruling would be robbed of meaning by a back-door thief" | KEY - Second Circuit; "back-door thief" quote |
| **Spratley v. FCA US LLC** | 2017 WL 4023348 (N.D.N.Y. 2017) | "The Court agrees with the majority of district courts... after Daimler, registration to do business in New York does not amount to consent to general jurisdiction" | Federal court rejecting consent |
| **Amelius v. Grand Imperial LLC** | 57 Misc.3d 835 (Sup. Ct. 2017) | Statutes "do not adequately apprise foreign corporations that they will be subject to general jurisdiction" | State court rejecting consent |

## CASE DISTINCTION STRATEGIES

### Multi-Factor Attack Template
When distinguishing opponent's cases, attack on multiple independent grounds:
1. **Plaintiff residency differences** - Was plaintiff actually a forum resident?
2. **Purchase location** - Was product purchased in forum state?
3. **Basis of claim** - Did claim arise from forum-state conduct?
4. **Type of action** - Class action vs. individual (fundamentally different)
5. **Claims asserted** - Forum state law claims vs. other state law

Each distinction independently undermines the case's applicability.

### Vacated Case Attack
**ALWAYS Shepardize/KeyCite opponent's cases.** Finding a case was vacated (like *Schmitigal*) is devastating - opponent's authority is simply invalid.

### "Directly Enticed" Language
Use *Antonini* language: Ford "directly enticed" plaintiff through targeted advertising in forum. Applies to used product market where manufacturer promotes resale.

### "Tire Hit Its Target" Quote
From *Michelin v. De Santiago*: "The used status of the tire does not disconnect Michelin from this lawsuit... Regardless of whether a 'new' or 'used' product was involved, Michelin's tire hit its target—a Texas consumer."

**Devastating for new vs. used product distinction argument.**

---

## EFFECTIVE CITATION PRACTICES

### Parenthetical Explanations
Use detailed parentheticals to explain relevance:
> *Daimler*, 571 US at 128, quoting *Goodyear*, 564 US at 925 (holding that general jurisdiction exists only where corporation is "essentially at home")

### Quote Integration
Adopt vivid language from favorable precedent:
- "Tire hit its target"
- "Directly enticed"
- "Relatively permissive"
- "Articulable nexus"
- "Tethered to New York"

### Cross-Jurisdictional Pattern
Document defendant's consistent losses across multiple jurisdictions to show pattern, not isolated result.

## DAIMLER RESPONSES

When opponent relies heavily on *Daimler*:

1. **Distinguish as General Jurisdiction Case** - Daimler addressed general, not specific jurisdiction
2. **Acknowledge but Pivot** - Daimler "creates a two-sided coin" - limits general jurisdiction but doesn't eliminate specific
3. **Third-Party Action Gap** - Daimler doesn't address third-party actions
4. **"Exceptional Circumstances"** - Daimler itself noted possible exceptions
5. **Consent Separate** - Daimler doesn't eliminate consent jurisdiction (forum selection clauses, etc.)
