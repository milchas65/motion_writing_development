# Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction - Motion Arc

**Purpose:** This document captures the structure, progression, and lifecycle insights for motions to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction under CPLR 3211(a)(8).

**Source Cases:** Aybar v. Ford Motor Co. (37 N.Y.3d 274), Aybar III (2d Dept 2022), Appellate Briefs

## JURISDICTIONAL FRAMEWORK

### Three Bases for Personal Jurisdiction in New York
1. **General Jurisdiction** - Defendant "at home" in NY (place of incorporation or principal place of business)
2. **Specific Jurisdiction** - Claim arises from or relates to defendant's NY contacts (CPLR 302)
3. **Consent Jurisdiction** - Forum selection clauses, stipulation, or potentially registration (limited after *Aybar*)

### Two-Component Constitutional Analysis
Personal jurisdiction requires:
1. **Service of Process** - Notice and opportunity to be heard (procedural due process)
2. **Power/Reach** - Court's authority over party to enforce decrees (substantive jurisdiction)

**Critical:** BCL registration satisfies only the first component (service), NOT jurisdiction itself.

## STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

### CPLR 302(a)(1) - Transaction of Business
**Two-Prong Test:**
1. **First Prong:** Defendant must have conducted sufficient activities to have "transacted business" in NY
2. **Second Prong:** Claims must "arise from" those transactions

**Key Standards:**
- First prong often conceded by major corporations doing substantial NY business
- Second prong requires "articulable nexus" or "substantial relationship" between cause of action and NY transactions
- Standard is "relatively permissive" - does NOT require causation (*Licci*, *Rushaid*)
- Claims must not be "completely unmoored" from NY transactions, but need not prove causation

### CPLR 302(a)(3) - Tortious Act Outside NY
**Three Requirements:**
1. Tortious act committed outside NY
2. Injury caused inside NY
3. Defendant either:
   - (i) Regularly does or solicits business in NY, OR
   - (ii) Derives substantial revenue from interstate commerce AND expects/should expect act to have NY consequences

**"Original Injury" Theory:** For out-of-state accidents involving NY residents who purchased products in NY, argue the "original event" giving rise to injury was the NY purchase of defective product. *Singer v. Walker*: "the place of the original event which caused the injury rather than the place of the resulting injury."

**Legislative History:** NY legislature "intended that tortious conduct without the state causing injury within the state shall be a predicate for long-arm jurisdiction whether or not the defendant had other contacts with the forum."

## DUE PROCESS ANALYSIS

### Minimum Contacts
- Defendant must have "purposefully availed" itself of forum state
- Must reasonably anticipate being haled into court in forum state
- Requires "something more than the fortuitous circumstance that a product sold in another state later makes its way into the forum jurisdiction" (*Williams v. Beemiller*)

### Five-Factor Reasonableness Test
Once minimum contacts established, court considers:
1. **Burden on defendant** - Major corps can rarely show meaningful burden
2. **Forum state's interest** - Strong when plaintiff is resident, defendant does business there
3. **Plaintiff's interest** - Convenient and effective relief
4. **Interstate system's efficiency** - Avoiding duplicative litigation
5. **States' shared substantive policy interests**

### Burden Shifting
"Where minimum contacts exist, the defendant has the burden to present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable." (*D & R Glob. Selections*, *LaMarca*)

**Defendants rarely meet this burden.** Courts consistently find major corporations cannot show unreasonable burden defending in states where they do substantial business.

## BRIEF STRUCTURE INSIGHTS

### Counter Questions Presented Format
When opposing appellant's questions presented, use "Counter Questions Presented" that reframe issues favorably:

**Example:** "Whether there is personal jurisdiction over Ford and Goodyear pursuant to CPLR 302(a)(1), where they concede that they 'transact business' in New York..."

**Technique:** Embed opponent's concessions directly into the question itself.

### First Prong Concession Exploitation
When opponent concedes first prong of CPLR 302(a)(1) (transacting business), structure entire argument around narrowing dispute:

**Opening:** "Ford and Goodyear concede... the only issue in dispute is the second prong."

### Statutory Text Inclusion
Include actual statutory text in argument section. Quote full CPLR 302(a)(1):
> "a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over any nondomiciliary... who in person or through an agent: 1. transacts any business within the state or contracts anywhere to supply goods or services in the state."

### Alternative Jurisdictional Bases
**CRITICAL LESSON from Aybar I:** Always plead multiple jurisdictional bases:
1. General jurisdiction (at home)
2. Specific jurisdiction under CPLR 302(a)(1)
3. Specific jurisdiction under CPLR 302(a)(3) as alternative
4. Consent theories (if applicable)

**Preserve all arguments even if some seem weaker.** Plaintiffs in Aybar I lost because they failed to preserve CPLR 302 specific jurisdiction argument below.

## THIRD-PARTY ACTION CONSIDERATIONS

### Unique Context
*Daimler* and its progeny have not specifically addressed third-party actions. Where jurisdiction is established among initial parties, courts may apply different standards for impleaded defendants.

### Third-Party Claims Can Establish Nexus
Third-party indemnification/contribution claims "could not exist but for" the defendant's alleged negligence in NY - this "tethers" the claims to NY and satisfies articulable nexus even when underlying accident occurred elsewhere.

### "Exceptional Circumstances" Carve-Out
Courts may characterize cases where:
- Jurisdiction is otherwise sound amongst initial parties
- Motor vehicle owned and registered in NY is involved
- Product is "transitory" (designed for interstate travel)

as an "exceptional circumstance," thereby moderating strict jurisdictional constraints.

---

## CONSENT JURISDICTION (Post-Aybar)

### Registration ≠ Consent to Jurisdiction
**Holding:** BCL registration and designation of agent for service = consent to accept service of process in NY. It does NOT = consent to general jurisdiction.

This overturns 100+ years of lower court interpretation of *Bagdon*.

### What Bagdon Actually Held
*Bagdon* was decided under *Pennoyer*'s territorial approach where in-state service on a present defendant was sufficient for jurisdiction. Court reinterpreted Bagdon as addressing "effect of service" not "consent to jurisdiction."

### Remaining Consent Options
- Forum selection agreements
- Stipulation to jurisdiction
- Potentially through course of conduct (appearing without objection)

---

## PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

### Motion Structure
- Filed under CPLR 3211(a)(8) - lack of jurisdiction over defendant
- Can be pre-answer motion
- Subject to CPLR 3211(e) single-motion rule considerations
- May combine with CPLR 3211(a)(7) (failure to state cause of action) to attack indemnification claims

### Cross-Motion Timing
- Cross-motions may be filed after favorable appellate decisions in related cases
- Strategic timing: File immediately after appellate ruling to leverage "binding precedent" argument
- Example: Ford's cross-motion filed 3 weeks after 2d Dept reversal in Aybar

### CPLR 3214(b) Automatic Stay
- Service of CPLR 3211 motion automatically stays disclosure
- Strategic use: Prevents jurisdictional discovery while motion pending
- Court may order otherwise, but movant should invoke stay

### Preservation Requirements
**CRITICAL:** Arguments not raised below are unpreserved for appeal.
- Must assert all jurisdictional theories at trial court level
- Cannot raise new theories on appeal
- Abandoning arguments = waiver
- **Aybar I Lesson:** Plaintiffs lost because they failed to preserve CPLR 302 specific jurisdiction argument

### Burden of Proof
- Plaintiff bears burden of establishing jurisdiction
- On motion to dismiss, court considers affidavits
- Plaintiff gets benefit of all reasonable inferences
- But plaintiff must actually MAKE the arguments to get the benefit

### Collateral Estoppel Considerations
- If same judge previously denied identical motion, collateral estoppel may apply
- Elements: (1) issue was raised, (2) litigated, (3) decided
- Applies even when motion re-filed after appellate decision in related case
- Key cases: *D'Arata*, *Keeler*, *DirecTV Latin America*

### Judicial Notice
- Court may take judicial notice of defendant's forum presence
- Evidence: defendant's own website showing service center locations
- Use to establish purposeful forum activities without formal discovery

## ADOPTION/INCORPORATION TECHNIQUE

When multiple respondents oppose same appeal:
- Lead brief can provide comprehensive legal analysis
- Co-respondent brief can "adopt and join in the arguments" by reference
- Allows comprehensive coverage without duplication
- Keep adopted brief focused on unique contributions
