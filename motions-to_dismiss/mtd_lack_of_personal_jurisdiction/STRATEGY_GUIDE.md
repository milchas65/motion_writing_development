# Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction - Strategy Guide

**Purpose:** Tactical considerations for both movants (defendants) and opponents (plaintiffs) in personal jurisdiction motions.

**Source Cases:** Aybar v. Ford Motor Co. (37 N.Y.3d 274), Aybar III (2d Dept 2022), Appellate Briefs

## STRATEGIES FOR OPPONENTS (PLAINTIFFS/RESPONDENTS)

### Preserve All Jurisdictional Theories

**CRITICAL LESSON from Aybar I:** Plaintiffs lost because they failed to preserve CPLR 302 specific jurisdiction argument below.

**Always Plead:**
1. General jurisdiction (at home) - even if weak
2. Specific jurisdiction under CPLR 302(a)(1) - transaction of business
3. Specific jurisdiction under CPLR 302(a)(3) - tortious act outside NY
4. Consent theories (if applicable)

**Preserve all arguments even if some seem weaker.** You cannot raise new theories on appeal.

---

### Exploit First Prong Concessions

When major corporations concede they "transact business" in NY (first prong of 302(a)(1)):

1. **Narrow the Dispute:** "The only issue in dispute is the second prong"
2. **Embed in Questions Presented:** Frame questions to include concession
3. **Focus Argument:** Concentrate firepower on articulable nexus only
4. **Use Against Burden Arguments:** Conceded business presence undermines burden claims

---

### Targeted Advertising as Jurisdictional Hook

**Key Evidence:**
- National/regional advertising spend (e.g., Ford's $2.28B annual advertising)
- Demographic targeting (e.g., 17%/$372M on Hispanic advertising)
- Forum-specific advertising campaigns
- Local dealership/service center advertising

**Argument:** "A manufacturer who invests millions of dollars in advertising to forum residents with the specific purpose of attracting the patronage of forum residents should not be heard to complain when served with process in that jurisdiction."

**Supporting Cases:**
- *Hamilton v. Accu-Tek* - gun manufacturers
- *State Farm v. Swizz Style* - Hispanic market targeting
- *Robins v. Procure Treatment Centers* - millions in advertising
- *Antonini v. Ford* - "directly enticed"

---

### Used Product Market Strategy

**Key Arguments:**
1. Manufacturers actively promote used product resale market through:
   - Service center infrastructure
   - Parts distribution networks
   - Warranty transfers
   - Certified pre-owned programs

2. Cannot disclaim jurisdiction over used product claims while profiting from used market

3. "Distinction Without Jurisdictional Difference" - *Michelin v. De Santiago*:
   > "The used status of the tire does not disconnect [manufacturer] from this lawsuit... Regardless of whether a 'new' or 'used' product was involved, Michelin's tire hit its target—a Texas consumer."

---

### CPLR 302(a)(3) as Alternative

Even when 302(a)(1) is strong, plead 302(a)(3) as fallback:

**Elements:**
1. Tortious act (defective design/manufacture) outside NY
2. Injury inside NY (NY resident injured using NY-purchased product)
3. Substantial revenue from interstate commerce

**"Original Injury" Theory:**
- Argue "original event" causing injury was NY purchase of defective product
- *Singer v. Walker*: "the place of the original event which caused the injury rather than the place of the resulting injury"
- Plaintiff purchased defective product in NY = injury IN NY for 302(a)(3)

---

### Burden Shift Exploitation

Once minimum contacts established (or conceded):

1. **Immediately Pivot:** "The burden now shifts to defendants"
2. **Quote Standard:** "present a compelling case that... jurisdiction [would be] unreasonable"
3. **Note Failure:** "Defendants have not even attempted to make that showing"
4. **Cite Factors:** Work through five-factor reasonableness test

**Key Point:** Defendants rarely meet this burden. Courts consistently find major corporations cannot show unreasonable burden defending in states where they do substantial business.

---

### Multi-Jurisdictional Loss Compilation

**Strategy:** Document defendant's consistent jurisdiction losses across multiple states to show pattern, not isolated result.

**Ford Example (13+ states):**
- Illinois (*Thomas v. Ford*)
- Florida (*Griffin v. Ford*)
- Texas (*Michelin v. De Santiago*)
- Minnesota (*Bandemer v. Ford* - SCOTUS cert)
- Montana (*Ford v. Montana* - SCOTUS cert)
- Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Oklahoma, Missouri, Washington, New Mexico, California

**Argument:** "The weight of authority demonstrates that courts consistently reject Ford's jurisdictional arguments."

---

### "Transitory Product" Doctrine

For vehicles and tires - products designed for interstate travel:

**Argument:**
- Products "designed and manufactured for the purpose of travel"
- Defendants cannot reasonably argue they didn't expect products to cross state lines
- "When the product is transitory, jurisdiction should appropriately follow, since the manufacturer intends the product to do so"

**George Washington Bridge Hypothetical:**
> "Whether the product failure happens in the westbound lanes or the eastbound lanes of the George Washington Bridge should not be the sole determining factor over jurisdiction."

Reduces opponent's position to arbitrary geographic formalism.

---

### Third-Party Action Context

**Arguments:**
- *Daimler* doesn't address third-party actions - "leaving a void"
- Where jurisdiction established among initial parties, different standard may apply
- Third-party claims "tethered" to forum because underlying conduct occurred there
- "Chilling effect" on third-party practice if strict limits applied

**Aybar III Success:** Where plaintiffs in Aybar I failed by not arguing CPLR 302, U.S. Tires in Aybar III succeeded. Same defendants, same products, different result because correct argument was made.

---

### Forum Shopping Reversal

When opponent raises forum shopping concerns:

**Distinguish Daimler:**
- *Daimler* addressed Argentine plaintiffs suing German company in California
- That's true forum shopping

**Your Case:**
- NY plaintiffs suing in NY
- "Were not engaged in forum shopping. They are both New York State residents"

---

### Due Process Balancing

**Argument:** "Nowhere is there any definitional requirement that personal jurisdiction be so tightly woven into one classification or the another that in protecting the due process rights of one litigant, it crushes the due process rights of the other."

Balance defendant's due process against plaintiff's right to access courts.

---

### 80-Year Registration Attack

Against burden arguments:

**Argument:** Defendants "made the affirmative choice over 80 years ago of duly registering with the Department of State to do business in New York and maintaining that registration."

- Voluntary, sustained forum participation
- Undercuts claims of burden
- "Apparently, the income earned from New York residents was significant enough to induce their voluntary registration"

---

## STRATEGIES FOR MOVANTS (DEFENDANTS)

### Plain Text Statutory Argument

**Approach:** BCL's plain text doesn't condition right to do business on consent to jurisdiction.

**Key Points:**
- Apply strict statutory construction
- "A different reading would improperly amend the statute by adding words that are not there"
- If legislature wanted consent-by-registration, it would have said so
- Point to what statute DOES say vs. what it DOESN'T say

---

### Historical Recontextualization

**Approach:** Reframe old precedent as product of its time.

**Bagdon Example:**
- Bagdon decided under *Pennoyer*'s territorial approach
- "Bagdon was about service, not jurisdiction"
- Historical context is key to reinterpretation
- "Must be understood in the context of the controlling jurisprudence of the time"

---

### Leverage SCOTUS Trends

**Approach:** Use *Daimler/Goodyear* trend of limiting general jurisdiction to support narrow readings.

- Even though those cases don't directly address specific jurisdiction or consent, they inform interpretive approach
- Courts are generally restricting jurisdiction, not expanding it
- "Unacceptably grasping" characterization of broad jurisdiction

---

### Concede First Prong Strategically

Major corporations doing substantial NY business may strategically concede first prong of 302(a)(1) to:
- Focus fight on second prong (articulable nexus)
- Appear reasonable to court
- Avoid discovery into business operations

---

### Distinguish "Unmoored" Claims

**Argument:** Claims are "completely unmoored" from NY activities.

**Framework:**
- Accident occurred outside NY
- Product not sold in NY (by defendant)
- No NY conduct related to alleged defect
- Connection to NY is "merely coincidental"

**Counter-Language:** Opponent will use "tethered," "connected," "linked"

---

### Constitutional Fallback

If statutory argument fails, preserve due process challenge:
- Minimum contacts not satisfied
- Unreasonable to exercise jurisdiction
- No purposeful availment
- Forum state has no legitimate interest

---

### Timing After Favorable Appellate Decision

**Strategy:** File motion immediately after favorable appellate ruling in related case.

**Example:** Ford filed cross-motion just 3 weeks after 2d Dept's January 23, 2019 Aybar reversal.

**Arguments:**
1. **Binding Precedent:** "The Appellate Division's decision is now binding on this Court"
2. **Collateral Estoppel:** Same issues already decided against same plaintiffs
3. **Law of the Case:** If same litigation, invoke law of the case doctrine

---

### CPLR 3214(b) Automatic Stay

**Tactical Use:** Invoke automatic stay of discovery during motion pendency.

> "Pursuant to CPLR 3214(b), service of a motion to dismiss automatically stays all disclosure until the determination of the motion unless the court orders otherwise."

Use this to avoid jurisdictional discovery while motion is pending.

---

### Multi-Prong Attack Structure

File under multiple CPLR 3211 subsections:
- **(a)(8):** Lack of personal jurisdiction (primary)
- **(a)(7):** Failure to state cause of action (attack indemnification claim)

**Indemnification Attack:**
- Common law indemnification requires vicarious liability only
- If plaintiff alleges third-party plaintiff's own negligence, indemnification fails
- *Raquet v. Braun*, 90 NY2d 177 (1997)
- *Board of Managers of Olive Park Condominium v. Maspeth Prop.*, 170 AD3d 645 (2d Dept 2019)

---

### Corporate Affidavit Evidence

Submit affidavit from corporate representative establishing:
- Where product was manufactured (outside NY)
- Where product was sold (outside NY)
- No NY involvement in design, manufacture, or sale of specific product
- Example: Pascarella Affidavit in Ford cross-motion

---

### CPLR 302(a)(2) Distinction

For foreign manufacturers, argue CPLR 302(a)(2) is inapplicable:

> "CPLR 302(a)(2) does not apply to the manufacture and subsequent export of goods to the forum state." (*Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. v. Barnes & Reinecke*, 15 NY2d 443)

Manufacturing outside NY is not a "tortious act within the state."

---

### Situs of Injury Argument

Under CPLR 302(a)(3), argue injury occurred outside NY:

> "The situs of the injury is the location of the original event which caused the injury." (*Paterno v. Laser Spine Inst.*, 24 NY3d 370)

If accident occurred outside NY, no 302(a)(3) jurisdiction regardless of plaintiff's residence.

---

### Constitutional Unconstitutional Conditions Doctrine

Against consent-by-registration argument:

> "The government may not condition the grant of a benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutional right." (*Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist.*, 570 US 595)

Conditioning right to do business on consent to jurisdiction would violate due process.

---

### Multi-Jurisdictional Defense Survey

Document defendant wins in other jurisdictions to show pattern:

**Ford Examples:**
- *Erwin v. Ford Motor Co.* (M.D. Fla. 2016)
- *Magill v. Ford Motor Co.* (Colo. 2016)
- *Kommer v. Ford Motor Co.* (N.D.N.Y. 2019)
- *Progressive County Mutual v. Goodyear* (S.D. Miss. 2019)

Present as weight of authority supporting dismissal.

---

## STRATEGIES FOR BOTH SIDES

### Vacated Case Research

**ALWAYS Shepardize/KeyCite opponent's cases.**

Finding a case was vacated (like *Schmitigal*) is devastating - opponent's authority is simply invalid. This is easy research that can eliminate key authority.

---

### Distinguish, Don't Ignore Adverse Cases

Courts expect parties to address unfavorable precedent.

**Technique:**
1. Acknowledge the case exists
2. Identify specific factual differences
3. Explain why those differences matter
4. Multiple distinguishing factors are better than one

**Example Distinctions:**
- Defendant didn't manufacture product (vs. did manufacture)
- Breach occurred outside NY (vs. in NY)
- Class action (vs. individual)
- Different state law claims
- Plaintiff not forum resident

---

### "Permissive" Standard Framing

**For Plaintiffs:** Hammer the "relatively permissive" language from *Licci/Rushaid*. It's a lower bar than defendants argue.

**For Defendants:** Emphasize that "permissive" doesn't mean "no standard" - there must still be articulable nexus, not mere coincidence.

---

### Forum State Interest

**Five-Factor Element:** New York's interest in adjudicating disputes involving:
- NY resident plaintiffs
- NY corporate defendants
- NY-located alleged breach
- Products purchased/serviced in NY

Strong forum interest supports jurisdiction.

---

### No Discernible Burden

**For Plaintiffs:** Major corporations cannot show meaningful burden defending in states where they do substantial business.

*Aybar III*: Court found "no discernible difference for companies such as Ford or Goodyear whether they defend an action in New York or Virginia."

---

## POST-AYBAR LANDSCAPE

After *Aybar v. Aybar* (2021), consent-by-registration is NOT available in NY.

**Plaintiffs Must Establish:**
1. Defendant is "at home" in NY (rare for out-of-state corps), OR
2. Specific jurisdiction under CPLR 302 (claim arises from NY contacts), OR
3. Contractual consent (forum selection clause)

**Specific jurisdiction under CPLR 302 is now the primary battleground.**
