## REPLY BRIEF FUNDAMENTALS

### Purpose of Reply Brief

A reply brief serves to:
1. Rebut arguments raised in opposition
2. Address new cases/authorities cited by opponent
3. Clarify or reinforce points from opening brief
4. Highlight what opponent failed to address

**Critical Rule:** Reply briefs should NOT raise new arguments not presented in the opening motion. Stay within the scope of responding to opposition arguments.

---

### Title Format

**Standard:**
> ATTORNEY AFFIRMATION IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF [DEFENDANT'S] MOTION TO DISMISS

**Alternative:**
> REPLY AFFIRMATION IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION

---

## BRIEF STRUCTURE

### Introduction Format

Open by identifying the brief's purpose and previewing opponent's arguments:

**Template:**
> This affirmation is submitted in further support of [Defendant's] motion to dismiss the [complaint/third-party complaint] for lack of personal jurisdiction. Specifically, it is submitted in response to [Plaintiff's/Opponent's] "Opposition" to [Defendant's] motion.

Then provide roadmap of opponent's arguments and your responses:

> [Opponent] raises [four] contrary arguments in their "Opposition." First, they argue [X]. However, [brief rebuttal]. Second, they argue [Y]. But [brief rebuttal]. Third... Fourth...

---

### Argument Organization

**Responsive Structure - Match Opponent's Arguments:**

**Point I:** [Opponent's First Argument] Is Without Merit
**Point II:** [Opponent's Second Argument] Should Be Rejected
**Point III:** [Opponent's Third Argument] Fails As a Matter of Law
**Point IV:** [Opponent's Fourth Argument] Should Be Summarily Rejected
**Point V:** [Opponent's Request for Discovery] Would Serve No Purpose

**Example from Goodyear Reply:**
- Point I: Collateral Estoppel Is Inapplicable
- Point II: Because Goodyear Is Not "At Home," This Court Should Not Exercise General Jurisdiction
- Point III: Goodyear Did Not Consent to Exercise of General Jurisdiction by Registering
- Point IV: Plaintiffs' Half-Hearted Attempt to Invoke Specific Jurisdiction Should Be Summarily Rejected
- Point V: Jurisdictional Discovery Would Serve No Purpose

---

### Incorporation by Reference

When responding to multiple opposition papers:

> For each of the reasons stated in [Defendant's] Reply to [First Opponent], which is incorporated by reference here. (See [Defendant's] Reply to [First Opponent], ¶¶ 9-23.)

**Purpose:** Avoids repetition when facing multiple oppositions raising similar arguments.

---

## RHETORICAL TECHNIQUES

### Dismissive Characterizations

**"Half-Hearted Attempt":**
> Plaintiffs' half-hearted attempt to invoke specific jurisdiction should be summarily rejected.

**"Meritless":**
> For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs' arguments are meritless.

**"Lend Them No Aid":**
> The decisions Plaintiffs cite... lend them no aid.

**"In Passing" Attack:**
> In passing, Plaintiffs state that "specific jurisdiction is... asserted." However, they offer no citations or argument to support that assertion.

---

### Strong Rebuttal Language

**"Flies in the Face":**
> That argument flies in the face of binding precedent from the Supreme Court of the United States.

**"Would Constitute Reversible Error":**
> Any such exercise of activity-based general jurisdiction would constitute reversible error.

**"Resounding No":**
> The majority of courts to consider [this issue] post-Daimler have answered with a resounding "no."

**"Disregard" Attack:**
> In so doing, Plaintiffs ignore that... Moreover, they disregard that...

---

### Majority/Minority View Framing

When opponent cites unfavorable cases:

> The decisions [Opponent] cites—including three that precede [controlling case], and the [unfavorable decision], which has been appealed—lend them no aid. They represent the minority view. The majority of courts to consider [this issue] post-[controlling case] have answered with a resounding "no."

Then provide extensive case list supporting majority view:

> See [Case 1] ("[Quote supporting your position]"); [Case 2] ("[Quote]"); [Case 3] ("[Quote]").

**Footnote Strategy:** Place extensive case citations in footnote to maintain readability while demonstrating weight of authority.

---

### "Back-Door Thief" Metaphor

From *Brown v. Lockheed Martin*:

> "[Opponent's] argument has been widely rejected with good reason. 'If mere registration... sufficed to confer general jurisdiction by implicit consent, every corporation would be subject to general jurisdiction in every state in which it registered, and Daimler's ruling would be robbed of meaning by a back-door thief.'" *Brown v. Lockheed Martin Corp.*, 814 F.3d 619, 640 (2d Cir. 2016).

---

### Waiver Arguments

When opponent fails to adequately develop an argument:

> [Opponent] state[s] that "specific jurisdiction is... asserted." However, they offer no citations or argument to support that assertion. Thus, they waive the right to present argument in favor of the exercise of specific jurisdiction.

---

### Defendant Focus Reversal

When opponent improperly emphasizes plaintiff's contacts:

> [Opponent] disregard[s] [key facts] and repeatedly urge[s] the Court to examine their own contacts with the State. But Plaintiff's relationship with the forum should not be part of the Court's jurisdictional calculus. It is not relevant that Plaintiffs live here, stored their vehicle here, or asked [defendant] to [perform services] here. "Rather, it is the *defendant's* conduct that must form the necessary connection with the forum State that is the basis for its jurisdiction over him." *Walden v. Fiore*, 571 U.S. 277, 285 (2014) (emphasis added).

---

## SPECIFIC REBUTTAL STRATEGIES

### Collateral Estoppel Rebuttal

When opponent argues issue preclusion from prior decision:

**Pending Appeal:**
> [Defendant] has not yet had a *full* and fair opportunity to litigate the issue at hand. The [prior decision] was appealed, and, during the pendency of that appeal, the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable as a matter of law.

**Purely Legal Issues:**
> The doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply to purely legal issues, e.g., statutory interpretation. Thus, it does not apply here, where the issue to be considered is the proper interpretation of New York's business registration statutory scheme.

**Materially Different Claims:**
> Collateral estoppel should not be applied here because the claims at issue in [prior case] are materially different from those at issue in this action. In [prior case], plaintiffs asserted [type of claims]. Here, by contrast, they assert [different type of claims].

---

### General Jurisdiction Rebuttal

**Not "At Home":**
> [Defendant] is not at home in the State of New York because it is not incorporated here and does not maintain its principal place of business here.

**"Operates in Many Places" Quote:**
> A "corporation that operates in many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them.... Nothing in International Shoe and its progeny suggests that a particular quantum of local activity should give a State authority over a far larger quantum of... activity having no connection to any in-state activity." *Daimler*, 571 U.S. at 139 n.20.

**BNSF Example:**
> The Supreme Court reaffirmed the limited bases for exercising general jurisdiction in *BNSF Railway Co. v. Tyrell*, in which the plaintiffs urged general jurisdiction based on defendant's significant business activities—over 2,000 miles of railroad track and more than 2,000 employees in the forum. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that defendant was not "so heavily engaged in activity" in the forum so "as to render it essentially at home" there. 137 S. Ct. at 1559.

**Regular Sales Insufficient:**
> "[E]ven regularly occurring sales of a product in a State do not justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim unrelated to those sales." *Goodyear Dunlop Tire Operations*, 564 U.S. at 930 n.6.

---

### Consent-by-Registration Rebuttal

**Conflation Attack:**
> [Opponent] conflate[s] [Defendant's] agreement to accept service of process with consent to the exercise of general jurisdiction.

**Pre-Daimler Cases:**
> The decisions [Opponent] cites—including [number] that precede *Bauman*—represent the minority view.

---

### Specific Jurisdiction Rebuttal

**Undisputed Manufacturing Facts:**
> [Opponent] do[es] not dispute that [Defendant] designed the [product] in [State] and manufactured it in [State], and they do not allege where, when, or to whom [Defendant] sold that [product].

**Black-Letter Law:**
> It is black-letter law that "mere injury to a forum resident is *not* a sufficient connection to the forum," *Walden v. Fiore*, 571 U.S. 277, 290 (2014), and "the plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the forum," *id.* at 285.

---

### Jurisdictional Discovery Rebuttal

**Futility Argument:**
> [Opponent] fail[s] to show that such discovery would aid the Court's resolution of [Defendant's] jurisdictional challenge. Neither a finding that [Defendant] is registered to do business in the State of New York nor findings pertaining to the extent of [Defendant's] sales or revenue in this State could possibly justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction.

**No Evidence of Connection:**
> There is no evidence of record suggesting (let alone showing) that [Defendant] has taken any actions in New York that relate to [Opponent's] claims.

---

## FOOTNOTE STRATEGY

### Strategic Uses of Footnotes

**Footnote 1 - Standing/Interest Attack:**
> [Opponent] sought and was granted leave to be heard on [Defendant's] motion. They have not, however, demonstrated how their interests could possibly be affected by [Defendant's] dismissal.

**Footnote 2 - Predict Reversal:**
> Indeed, it is likely that the [unfavorable decision] will be reversed. [Defendant's] appeal is still pending before the [Appellate Court].

**Footnote 3 - Additional Facts from Other Proceedings:**
> See, e.g., [Related Case] (finding that [relevant fact]).

**Footnote 4 - Note What Opponent Didn't Dispute:**
> Further, [Opponent] do[es] not dispute that [Third-Party Plaintiff's] common law indemnification claim fails as a matter of law.

**Footnote 5 - Extensive Case Citations:**
> See also, e.g., [Case 1] ("[Quote]"); [Case 2] ("[Quote]"); [Case 3] ("[Quote]"); [Case 4] ("[Quote]"); [Case 5] ("[Quote]").

---

## CONCLUSION FORMAT

**Standard Closing:**

> [Defendant] is not subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court, in this lawsuit.
>
> Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons and also for the reasons stated in [Defendant's] opening affirmation [and [Defendant's] Reply to [Other Opponent]], the [claims] asserted against [Defendant] should be dismissed with prejudice.
