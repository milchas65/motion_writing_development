PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

[Opening: State that court lacks personal jurisdiction]

[Body: Preview jurisdictional deficiencies]

[Closing: Request dismissal]
```

## Content Elements

### Opening
> This Court lacks personal jurisdiction over [Defendant] because [Defendant] has no contacts with [forum state] sufficient to support either general or specific jurisdiction.

### Jurisdictional Analysis Preview
- Defendant's lack of forum contacts
- No "doing business" in forum (general jurisdiction)
- Claims do not arise from forum contacts (specific jurisdiction)
- Constitutional due process concerns

### Types of Arguments

**No General Jurisdiction:**
> [Defendant] is not "at home" in [State]. [Defendant] is incorporated in [State] and has its principal place of business in [State]. [Defendant] has no offices, employees, or continuous presence in [forum state].

**No Specific Jurisdiction:**
> The claims in this action do not arise from any contacts [Defendant] has with [State]. The alleged [conduct/transaction] occurred entirely in [other location].

## Example

> ABC Corp. is a Delaware corporation headquartered in California. It has no offices, employees, or registered agent in New York. ABC Corp. does not regularly transact business in New York and is not licensed to do business here. The single transaction at issue occurred entirely in California between California parties. This Court lacks personal jurisdiction.
