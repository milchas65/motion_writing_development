# Motion to Dismiss Overview (Lack of Personal Jurisdiction)

## Applicable Rules
- **New York:** CPLR 3211(a)(8)
- **Federal:** Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2)

## Legal Standard

### Burden
> On a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that the court has jurisdiction over the defendant. *Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank*, 673 F.3d 50, 59 (2d Cir. 2012).

### Types of Jurisdiction

**General Jurisdiction:**
Defendant must be "at home" in the forum—typically only state of incorporation and principal place of business. *Daimler AG v. Bauman*, 571 U.S. 117 (2014).

**Specific Jurisdiction:**
Claims must "arise out of or relate to" defendant's contacts with the forum. *Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court*, 137 S. Ct. 1773 (2017).
