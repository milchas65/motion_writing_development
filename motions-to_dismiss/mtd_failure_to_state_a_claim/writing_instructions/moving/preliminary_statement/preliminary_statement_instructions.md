[Body: Preview the pleading deficiencies]

[Closing: Request dismissal]
```

## Content Elements

### Opening
> Defendant moves to dismiss the complaint because it fails to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted.

### Pleading Deficiencies
- Identify missing elements
- Note conclusory allegations
- Explain why legal theories fail

### Types of Deficiencies

**Missing Elements:**
> Plaintiff's [claim type] claim fails because the complaint does not allege [essential element].

**Conclusory Allegations:**
> The complaint offers only conclusory labels and legal conclusions, not factual allegations supporting the claim.

**Legal Bar:**
> Even accepting all allegations as true, Plaintiff's claim is barred by [legal doctrine].

## Example

> The complaint should be dismissed because it fails to plead the essential elements of fraud. The complaint does not allege: (1) what specific misrepresentations were made; (2) when they were made; (3) by whom; or (4) why Plaintiff's reliance was reasonable. These deficiencies are fatal under the heightened pleading standard for fraud claims.
