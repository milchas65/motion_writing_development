# Motion to Dismiss Overview (Failure to State a Claim)

## Applicable Rules
- **New York:** CPLR 3211(a)(7)
- **Federal:** Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)

## Legal Standard

### New York
> On a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, the court must accept the factual allegations as true, accord plaintiff the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory. *Leon v. Martinez*, 84 N.Y.2d 83, 87-88 (1994).

### Federal
> To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).

## Key Principles

1. **Accept allegations as true** - but not legal conclusions
2. **Focus on pleading deficiencies** - missing elements, conclusory allegations
3. **Apply correct standard** - plausibility (federal) vs. cognizable theory (NY)
4. **Request dismissal with or without prejudice** - consider whether amendment could cure
