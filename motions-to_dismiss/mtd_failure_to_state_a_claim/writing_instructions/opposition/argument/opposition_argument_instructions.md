# Argument Section Instructions

## Purpose
Demonstrate that each cause of action in the Complaint states a plausible claim for relief that survives the motion to dismiss.

## Overall Structure

### Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)
- State that the Complaint more than satisfies the pleading standard
- Preview that each cause of action will be addressed
- Assert that accepting allegations as true reveals plausible claims

### Per-Claim Arguments
For EACH cause of action, create a separate sub-section:

```
I. THE [CLAIM TYPE] CLAIM STATES A PLAUSIBLE CLAIM FOR RELIEF

    A. Elements of [Claim Type]

    B. The Complaint Adequately Alleges Each Element
       1. [Element 1]
       2. [Element 2]
       3. [Element 3]

    C. [If applicable] Defendant's Cases Are Distinguishable
```

## Element-by-Element Analysis

### A. State the Elements
- Cite the controlling case that establishes the elements
- List each element clearly
- Use the exact formulation from your jurisdiction

Example:
> To state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty under New York law, a plaintiff must allege: (1) a fiduciary relationship; (2) misconduct by the defendant; and (3) damages directly caused by the defendant's misconduct. *Rut v. Young Adult Inst., Inc.*, 74 A.D.3d 776, 777 (2d Dep't 2010).

### B. Match Allegations to Elements
For EACH element:
1. State the element
2. Quote or cite the specific complaint paragraphs that satisfy it
3. Explain why these allegations are sufficient

Example:
> **First**, the Complaint alleges a fiduciary relationship. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant "served as Plaintiff's financial advisor and investment manager, holding himself out as acting solely in Plaintiff's best interests." (Compl. ¶ 15.) Plaintiff further alleges that he "placed complete trust and confidence in Defendant to manage his retirement savings." (Compl. ¶ 17.) These allegations, accepted as true, establish a fiduciary relationship. *See Mandelblatt v. Devon Stores, Inc.*, 132 A.D.2d 162, 168 (1st Dep't 1987).

### C. Distinguish Defendant's Cases (if applicable)
If defendant cited unfavorable cases:
1. Briefly state the case and its holding
2. Explain why it's distinguishable:
   - Different facts
   - Different procedural posture
   - Different legal theory
   - Superseded by later authority

Example:
> Defendant's reliance on *Smith v. Jones* is misplaced. In *Smith*, the complaint contained only "bare legal conclusions" without factual support. 123 F.3d at 456. Here, by contrast, Plaintiff alleges specific facts: the dates of the misrepresentations (Compl. ¶¶ 22-25), the content of each false statement (Compl. ¶¶ 26-30), and the documents in which they appeared (Compl. ¶¶ 31-35). This level of factual detail far exceeds what was found insufficient in *Smith*.

## Point Headings

### Use Assertive, Conclusory Headings
Point headings should state your conclusion, not just the topic.

**Good:**
> I. THE FRAUD CLAIM STATES A PLAUSIBLE CLAIM BECAUSE THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES EACH ELEMENT WITH SPECIFICITY

**Bad:**
> I. THE FRAUD CLAIM
> I. PLAINTIFF'S FRAUD ALLEGATIONS

### Numbered Structure
Use Roman numerals for main claims, capital letters for sub-arguments:
- I. First Cause of Action
  - A. Elements
  - B. Allegations Satisfy Each Element
  - C. Defendant's Cases Are Distinguishable
- II. Second Cause of Action
  - etc.

## Citation Practice

### Citing the Complaint
- Use paragraph numbers: (Compl. ¶ 12)
- For ranges: (Compl. ¶¶ 12-15)
- For specific quotes: (Compl. ¶ 12 ("quoted text"))

### Citing Cases
- Full citation first use
- Short form thereafter: *Twombly*, 550 U.S. at 570
- Pin cites always required

### Using SFP Context
If Standardized Fact Patterns are available:
- Use them to frame the dispute
- Connect the legal elements to the factual pattern
- Show how the pattern supports plausibility

## Tone

### Be Confident
- "The Complaint clearly alleges..."
- "These allegations unquestionably establish..."
- "Accepting these facts as true, the claim is plainly plausible..."

### Avoid Hedging
- NOT: "Plaintiff alleges that defendant may have..."
- YES: "Defendant made false statements to Plaintiff..."

### Focus on Your Strengths
- Lead with your strongest allegations
- Don't bury important facts
- If an element is weak, address it directly but briefly

## Common Claim Types

### Fraud
- Heightened pleading (9(b) / CPLR 3016(b))
- Must allege: who, what, when, where, how
- Scienter can be alleged generally but must have factual basis

### Breach of Contract
- Existence of contract
- Plaintiff's performance
- Defendant's breach
- Damages

### Breach of Fiduciary Duty
- Fiduciary relationship
- Breach of duty
- Damages caused by breach

### Negligence
- Duty
- Breach
- Causation
- Damages

### Unjust Enrichment
- Defendant enriched
- At plaintiff's expense
- Inequitable to retain benefit

## Length
- 2-4 pages per cause of action
- More complex claims may require more space
- Consolidate similar claims if appropriate

## Advanced Argument Techniques

### Layered Defense Strategy
Don't rely on a single argument. Build multiple, independent grounds for denial:

1. **Substantive sufficiency** - The complaint adequately pleads all required elements
2. **Procedural compliance** - The pleading meets all technical requirements
3. **Standard of review** - Defendant misapplies or overstates the dismissal standard

Example approach:
> An opposition argued (1) all elements were adequately pleaded AND (2) defendant applied the wrong legal standard AND (3) defendant's cited cases were distinguishable. Any one ground warranted denial.

### Using Analogous Survival Decisions
When you find a recent case with similar allegations that survived dismissal:

1. **Introduce it prominently:** "Recently, in [Case], the court denied a motion to dismiss a nearly identical claim."
2. **Describe the allegations:** Show the factual parallels to your complaint
3. **Quote the holding:** State what the court found sufficient
4. **Draw the connection:** "Like the plaintiff in [case], Plaintiff here alleges..."

This technique is especially powerful with:
- Cases from the same court or judge
- Recent decisions applying current pleading standards
- Cases with similar fact patterns that survived

### Reframing Defendant's Attacks
Turn defendant's arguments against them:
- If defendant calls allegations "conclusory," show they are supported by specific facts
- If defendant says facts are "implausible," cite cases where similar facts survived
- If defendant argues "missing elements," point to the specific paragraphs that satisfy each element

### Lead with Procedural Bars
When available, place procedural objections BEFORE substantive arguments. Procedural bars can defeat the motion entirely without reaching the merits:

1. **Timeliness issues** - Motion filed too early (before joinder of issue) or too late
2. **Improper form** - Missing affidavits, defective notice
3. **Waiver** - Issue not preserved, prior inconsistent position
4. **Preclusion** - Law of the case, res judicata

Example structure:
```
POINT I: THE MOTION IS PREMATURE BECAUSE ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN JOINED
POINT II: EVEN IF CONSIDERED, THE COMPLAINT STATES A CLAIM
```

The procedural argument may dispose of the motion; the substantive argument provides a fallback.

### Distinguishing Cases En Masse
When defendant cites multiple cases, address them systematically rather than individually. Show the pattern of distinction:

> In each of the cases cited by Defendant on this point, the transaction had concluded, the defendant acknowledged owing a fixed sum without conditions, and the amount acknowledged was not subject to future events. *See Jones*, 18 A.D.3d at 791 (amount of post-closing set-offs); *Smith*, 302 A.D.2d at 990 (amount owed to subcontractor for completed work); *Brown*, 179 A.D.2d at 527 (compensation to former employee). None of those circumstances is present here.

This technique efficiently dispatches multiple authorities while demonstrating they share a common, inapplicable thread.

### Turning Opponent's Evidence Against Them
Highlight when defendant's own submissions undermine their position:

- **Selective quotation:** "Defendant bases its motion on selective extracts from the letters, quoting the portions it finds favorable and ignoring those it does not. Such legerdemain is unavailing."

- **Admissions against interest:** "Defendant's own exhibit confirms that [fact favorable to plaintiff]."

- **Internal contradictions:** "Defendant cannot simultaneously argue [X] and [Y]."

### Creating Issues of Fact (Summary Judgment Context)
When opposing summary judgment, affirmatively show that triable issues exist:

1. **Attack defendant's proof:** Show movant failed to prove elements conclusively
   > "Defendant nowhere states the amount it claims to be owed and offers no proof that the amounts tendered were not the amounts actually owed. These omissions create a self-defeating issue of fact."

2. **Highlight disputed facts:** Point to conflicting evidence or competing interpretations

3. **Emphasize credibility issues:** Note that credibility determinations are for the trier of fact

4. **Show movant's burden:** Remind the court that defendant bears the burden to "dispel any question of fact"

### The "Nothing to Complain About" Technique
When addressing multiple complaints from the opposing party, use a consistent dismissive refrain:

> Defendant complains about not having received any remittance of principal. Defendant has nothing to complain about. None of the borrowers repaid any principal prior to the maturity date, so there was never any principal to remit.
>
> Defendant complains about not having received an interest payment since November 2016. Defendant has only itself to blame. [Explanation.]

This technique efficiently addresses grievances while emphasizing that defendant's complaints are meritless or self-inflicted.

### The "It Is Undisputed" Framing
Establish facts favorable to your position by asserting they are undisputed, shifting the burden to defendant to create genuine issues:

> It is undisputed that no Noteholder has notified BANA of an intent to assert claims -- or take any other action -- with respect to the Impounded Income. (SMF ¶¶ 54, 58.)

> It is undisputed that BANA withheld the Impounded Income beyond multiple Payment Dates in violation of the Indenture.

This framing:
1. **Establishes facts affirmatively** rather than defensively
2. **Shifts the burden** to defendant to show a dispute exists
3. **Signals confidence** that the record supports your position
4. **Sets up summary judgment** arguments if appropriate

Use sparingly and only for facts genuinely supported by the record. Overuse weakens the technique.

### Contract Interpretation Arguments
When the dispute involves contract language, use established canons of construction to show defendant's reading is untenable:

**Against Rendering Terms Meaningless:**
> "Such a construction would contravene New York law. *See Acme Supply Co. v. City of N.Y.*, 834 N.Y.S.2d 142, 143 (1st Dep't 2007) ('[a] court should not adopt an interpretation which will operate to leave a provision of a contract without force and effect')."

**Reading the Contract as a Whole:**
> "Particular words should be considered, not as if isolated from the context, but in the light of the obligation as a whole and the intention of the parties as manifested thereby." *Atwater & Co. v. Pan. R.R. Co.*, 246 N.Y. 519, 524 (1927).

**Against Absurd Results:**
> "Courts are 'not required to disregard common sense and slavishly bow to the written word where to do so would plainly ignore the true intentions of the parties in the making of a contract.'" *Milt Holdings LLC v. 181 PM LLC*, 2009 N.Y. Misc. LEXIS 2637, at *7 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. Co. Mar. 20, 2009).

These canons allow you to show that defendant's interpretation, even if literally possible, contradicts established principles of contract law.

### Defending Fraud Claims from "Duplicative" Attacks

#### "Present Fact" vs "Future Promise" Distinction
When defendant argues fraud claims are merely disguised breach of contract claims, emphasize that representations about experience, skills, ability, and methodology are statements of PRESENT FACT, not mere promises of future performance:

> "In its June 2021 project proposal, Defendant represented that D-LIFE was a 'pre-configured solution' that was 'proven to accelerate results'... These are false statements of *present fact* made to induce Plaintiff to hire Defendant."

Key categories of present-fact representations:
- Existing experience and expertise
- Current skills and qualifications
- Available tools, methodology, or resources
- Present ability to perform

#### "Ability to Perform" as Present Fact
Defendant's misrepresentation of its *ability* to perform is a statement of present fact (actionable), not a future promise:

> "Defendant's pre-contract representations concerning its purported ability to perform—e.g., that it had the ability to 'fast-track design, development, and testing,' 'scale the program faster and more efficiently than anyone else'—are likewise actionable."

Cite *Shear Enters., LLC v. Cohen* (holding "defendants misrepresented their very 'ability to perform' [was] an allegation that supports a non-duplicative fraudulent inducement claim").

#### Distinct Damages Defeats Duplication
Fraud claims seek different damages than contract claims:
- **Contract:** "benefit of the bargain" damages
- **Fraud:** "out of pocket" damages + RESCISSION

> "For its breach of contract claim, Plaintiff seeks a return of the fees... By contrast, for its fraudulent inducement claim, Plaintiff seeks rescission of the Contracts and the sum necessary to restore Plaintiff to the position occupied before the commission of the fraud."

Rescission is a fraud remedy unavailable for breach of contract—this alone defeats the duplication argument.

### Defeating Particularity/Intent Attacks

#### "Peculiarly Within Defendant's Knowledge"
When defendant attacks the particularity of fraud allegations, argue that the details are peculiarly within defendant's knowledge:

> "Defendant's purported abilities, capabilities, skills, experience, expertise, and qualifications to perform and provide services... were peculiarly within Defendant's knowledge. Those representations, when contrasted with Defendant's abject performance failures, support an inference that Defendant's pre-contract representations were knowingly false."

Courts are reluctant to dismiss fraud claims at the pleading stage when facts are peculiarly within defendant's knowledge.

#### Inferring Intent from Subsequent Conduct
Fraudulent intent can be inferred from the circumstances, especially subsequent performance failures:

> "Fraudulent intent, by its very nature, is rarely susceptible to direct proof and must be established by inference from the circumstances surrounding the allegedly fraudulent act."

The complaint's detailed allegations of performance failures support an inference that defendant never had the ability or intention to fulfill its representations.

### Defeating Reliance/Merger Clause Attacks

#### Merger Clause "Too General" Defense
General/boilerplate merger clauses don't bar fraudulent inducement claims—they must specifically disclaim the particular misrepresentations at issue:

> "Where, as here, a merger clause is 'general and vague,' i.e., merely 'an omnibus statement that the written instrument embodies the whole agreement, or that no representations have been made,' the merger clause does not preclude plaintiff from establishing that it was fraudulently induced."

Quote *Sabo v. Delman*: "if it were otherwise, a defendant would have it in his power to perpetrate a fraud with immunity, depriving the victim of all redress, if he simply has the foresight to include a merger clause."

#### Reliance Is a Fact Question
Reasonable reliance is almost always a fact question requiring discovery:

> "In any event, reasonable reliance 'is a question for the trier of fact' that cannot be decided on a motion to dismiss."

### Defeating "Special Relationship" Attacks

#### "Special Facts Doctrine"
For constructive fraud or negligent misrepresentation claims requiring a "special relationship," the "special facts doctrine" provides an alternative to formal fiduciary relationship:

> "The 'special facts' doctrine directly supplants the need for a formal fiduciary relationship... substitutes for a formal fiduciary relationship where 'the material facts [are] within the knowledge of the defendants and [] such information could not be discovered by plaintiffs through the exercise of ordinary intelligence.'"

Apply when defendant had superior knowledge of material facts that plaintiff could not have independently discovered.

### Defeating Acceptance/Waiver Defenses

#### Concealment Defeats "Acceptance"
If defendant concealed defects, plaintiff could not "knowingly" accept deliverables. Waiver requires "voluntary relinquishment of a KNOWN right":

> "Plaintiff could neither knowingly reject or accept deliverables within 15 days because it did not, and could not, know they were defective until after go-live, when systemic failures surfaced. Defendant's concealment of systemic risks made meaningful review and approval impossible."

Also argue that a party "cannot claim the other failed to meet a condition when that party's own actions made compliance impossible."

#### Contract Ambiguity Defeats MTD
If the acceptance/notice procedure is ambiguous, the issue cannot be resolved at motion to dismiss stage:

> "As a contractual matter, the procedure for accepting deliverables is ambiguous, making dismissal of Plaintiff's contract claim inappropriate. If the court concludes that a contract is ambiguous, it cannot be construed as a matter of law, and dismissal under CPLR 3211(a)(7) is not appropriate."

Point to undefined terms, missing definitions, or conflicting provisions to show ambiguity.
# Discovery Argument Instructions (CPLR 3212(f))

## Document Information
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Created**: December 5, 2025
- **Purpose**: Instructions for generating CPLR 3212(f) / Rule 56(d) discovery arguments
- **Section**: ARGUMENT - Discovery Needed

---

## Purpose of This Section

This section argues that summary judgment should be denied (or decision reserved) because:
1. Discovery is incomplete
2. Essential facts are unavailable to the opposing party
3. Those facts are within movant's control or require third-party discovery

---

## Legal Standard

### New York (CPLR 3212(f))

> CPLR 3212(f) provides that summary judgment may be denied or decision reserved where "facts essential to justify opposition may exist but cannot then be stated."

Key requirements:
1. Identify specific facts needed
2. Explain why facts are essential to opposition
3. Show facts are in movant's possession or require third-party discovery
4. Demonstrate diligence in pursuing discovery

**Key Cases:**
- *Global Mins. & Metals Corp. v. Holme*, 35 A.D.3d 93, 103 (1st Dep't 2006)
- *Voluto Ventures, LLC v. Jenkens & Gilchrist Parker Chapin LLP*, 44 A.D.3d 557 (1st Dep't 2007)

### Federal (Rule 56(d))

> Rule 56(d) permits the court to defer or deny summary judgment where the nonmovant "shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition."

---

## When to Include This Section

Include this argument when:
- Depositions have not been taken
- Document discovery is outstanding
- Third-party discovery is needed
- Movant has exclusive access to key information
- The motion is filed early in the case

**Do NOT include if:**
- Discovery is complete
- The needed facts are already in the record
- The opposing party has been dilatory in discovery

---

## Structure

### Point Heading
> **V. AT MINIMUM, FURTHER DISCOVERY IS NEEDED PURSUANT TO CPLR 3212(f)**

or

> **V. THE MOTION IS PREMATURE BECAUSE ESSENTIAL FACTS ARE UNAVAILABLE WITHOUT FURTHER DISCOVERY**

### A. Legal Standard

State the CPLR 3212(f) / Rule 56(d) standard:

> Where facts essential to opposition "may exist but cannot then be stated," summary judgment should be denied or decision reserved pending discovery. CPLR 3212(f); *Global Mins. & Metals Corp. v. Holme*, 35 A.D.3d 93, 103 (1st Dep't 2006).

### B. Discovery Is Incomplete

Identify what discovery remains:

> Discovery in this action is far from complete. The following remains outstanding:
>
> - **Depositions**: [List witnesses not yet deposed]
> - **Document Production**: [Identify outstanding document requests]
> - **Third-Party Discovery**: [Identify needed third-party discovery]
> - **Interrogatories**: [If applicable]

### C. Essential Facts Are Within Movant's Knowledge or Control

Identify specific facts needed and explain why they are essential:

> The following facts, essential to [Opposing Party]'s opposition, are within [Moving Party]'s exclusive knowledge or control:
>
> 1. **[Fact Category]**: [Explain what is needed and why it is essential to the opposition. Explain how it could create a triable issue.]
>
> 2. **[Fact Category]**: [Same structure]

### D. Opposing Party Has Been Diligent

Address any suggestion that the opposing party delayed:

> [Opposing Party] has diligently pursued discovery in this matter. [Describe discovery efforts.] [Moving Party]'s motion, filed [timing], does not afford [Opposing Party] adequate opportunity to develop the record.

If movant caused delay:
> Indeed, [Moving Party]'s own conduct has impeded discovery. [Describe movant's delays or obstruction.]

### E. Specific Discovery Needed

Be specific about what discovery would provide:

> With the benefit of [specific discovery], [Opposing Party] would be able to [explain how discovery would create fact issues or defeat the motion].

---

## Specificity Requirements

Courts reject vague 3212(f) arguments. Be specific:

### Vague (Insufficient):
> Discovery is incomplete and might reveal helpful information.

### Specific (Sufficient):
> [Opposing Party] has not yet deposed [Witness Name], who was present at the March 15 meeting where the alleged agreement was reached. [Witness]'s testimony regarding what was said at that meeting—information exclusively within [Moving Party]'s knowledge—is essential to establishing the existence of an oral modification. Without this testimony, [Opposing Party] cannot fully oppose [Moving Party]'s contention that no modification occurred.

---

## Common Discovery Needs

### Depositions
> [Opposing Party] has not yet had the opportunity to depose [Moving Party]'s key witnesses, including [Name], who [role/knowledge]. This testimony is essential to [explain relevance].

### Documents
> [Moving Party] has not produced documents responsive to [Opposing Party]'s [Request No. __], seeking [description]. These documents would [explain relevance].

### Third-Party Discovery
> [Third Party] possesses information regarding [subject] that is essential to [Opposing Party]'s claims. Subpoenas have been issued but returns are not yet due.

### Expert Discovery
> Expert discovery has not commenced. [Opposing Party]'s expert will opine on [subject], which is directly relevant to [issue on which summary judgment is sought].

---

## Drafting Guidelines

### DO:
- Identify specific facts needed, not general categories
- Explain why each fact is essential to opposition
- Show connection between needed discovery and issues in motion
- Demonstrate diligence in pursuing discovery
- Explain how discovery would create fact issues

### DO NOT:
- Make vague assertions that "more discovery is needed"
- Seek discovery on issues not raised in the motion
- Blame movant without supporting evidence
- Request discovery on immaterial issues
- Suggest fishing expeditions

---

## Supporting Evidence

This argument is strengthened by:
- Attorney affirmation describing discovery efforts
- Discovery schedule showing outstanding items
- Correspondence showing diligent pursuit
- Motion history showing movant's delays (if applicable)

Reference these in the brief:
> As set forth in the accompanying affirmation of [Attorney Name], [Opposing Party] has [describe efforts].

---

## Alternative Relief

Request alternative relief:

> In the alternative, should the Court be inclined to consider [Moving Party]'s motion, [Opposing Party] respectfully requests that decision be reserved pursuant to CPLR 3212(f) pending completion of discovery, or that the Court permit expedited discovery on the issues raised in the motion.

---

## Length Guidance

This section should be:
- **Concise**: 1-2 pages typically
- **Specific**: Every assertion should identify concrete facts/discovery
- **Focused**: Address only discovery relevant to the motion

---

## Output Format

Generate this section with:
- **POINT HEADING** in bold, caps
- Subheadings (#### A., #### B., etc.)
- Numbered or bulleted lists for discovery items
- Specific citations to discovery requests, correspondence, or affirmations
- Clear connection between needed discovery and motion issues
