# Legal Standard Section Instructions

## Purpose
Establish the legal framework that governs the Court's analysis of the motion to dismiss. Frame the standard in a way that favors denying the motion.

## Structure

### Opening Paragraph
State the applicable rule and its fundamental purpose:
- Federal: Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)
- New York: CPLR 3211(a)(7)
- California: CCP § 430.10

### Core Standard
Quote the controlling standard from the leading case:

**Federal:**
> "To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to 'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"
> — *Ashcroft v. Iqbal*, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)

**New York:**
> "On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(7), the court must afford the pleadings a liberal construction, accept the allegations of the complaint as true, accord plaintiff the benefit of every possible favorable inference, and determine only whether the facts as alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory."
> — *Leon v. Martinez*, 84 N.Y.2d 83, 87-88 (1994)

**California:**
> "In reviewing a demurrer, courts accept as true all properly pleaded material allegations and give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in context."
> — *Blank v. Kirwan*, 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 (1985)

### Plaintiff-Favorable Principles
Emphasize each of these with supporting citations:

1. **Accept Facts as True**
   - All well-pleaded factual allegations must be accepted as true
   - Court cannot weigh evidence or assess credibility
   - The question is not whether plaintiff will prove the claim

2. **Draw Favorable Inferences**
   - All reasonable inferences must be drawn in plaintiff's favor
   - Ambiguities resolved for non-movant
   - Facts viewed in light most favorable to plaintiff

3. **Liberal Construction**
   - Pleadings construed liberally (especially in NY)
   - Focus on substance over form
   - Technical defects insufficient for dismissal

4. **Plausibility, Not Probability**
   - Standard is plausibility, not probability of success
   - Detailed factual pleading not required
   - Complaint need only give fair notice of claims

### What Defendant Cannot Do
The motion to dismiss is LIMITED:
- Cannot challenge truthfulness of allegations
- Cannot argue plaintiff won't prove the case
- Cannot introduce facts outside the complaint
- Cannot weigh competing inferences

### Dismissal Disfavored
Conclude by noting that dismissal is a drastic remedy:
- Granted sparingly
- Only when no set of facts could support claim
- Doubt resolved in favor of plaintiff

## Length
1-2 pages. This section should be thorough but not overly long. The real work is in the Argument section.

## Common Mistakes
- Quoting defendant's cases without distinguishing them
- Failing to quote the controlling standard
- Missing the "all inferences for plaintiff" principle
- Being too brief - this section sets up your entire argument
