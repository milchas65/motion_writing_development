**RE:**      Recent New York County Commercial Division Decisions Resolving Party Discovery Disputes

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum summarizes recent decisions from the New York County Commercial Division addressing party discovery disputes. These cases provide guidance on the court's approach to motions to compel, discovery sanctions, ESI production requirements, and privilege issues.

## II. DISCOVERY SANCTIONS / STRIKING PLEADINGS

### A. O'Rourke v. Hammerstein Ballroom
**Justice Margaret A. Chan | August 22, 2024**

The court dismissed plaintiff's complaint after plaintiff failed to appear for eight separate court-ordered depositions between November 2021 and January 2024. Justice Chan held that "the sanction befitting the lackadaisical handling of this case is dismissal of plaintiff's complaint," emphasizing that failure to comply with court-ordered deadlines and discovery can lead to the striking of a party's pleading.

### B. Five Star Electric Corp. v. The Trustees of Columbia University
**Index No. 655947/2018 | Justice Joel M. Cohen | September 30, 2024**

The court granted defendants' motion to strike plaintiff's complaint pursuant to CPLR § 3126 for discovery violations. This case demonstrates the Commercial Division's willingness to impose severe sanctions for repeated discovery misconduct.

### C. Earthlink, LLC v. Charter Communications Operating, LLC
**Justice Andrea Masley | January 18, 2024**

The court granted sanctions against defendant Charter Communications Operating, LLC for spoliation of evidence. The decision rejected Charter's claim that preserving recordings of millions of calls over several months was impossible, holding the defendant accountable for its failure to implement adequate litigation holds.

### D. EXRP 14 Holdings LLC v. LS-15 Ave LLC
**Justice Melissa A. Crane | September 5, 2024**

Following a prior grant of plaintiff's motion for sanctions, the court declined to award plaintiff the full amount of requested attorneys' fees and reduced the requested amount by 50%. This decision provides guidance on the court's approach to fee awards in discovery sanction matters.

## III. MOTIONS TO COMPEL

### A. Bangladesh Bank v. Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation
**Index No. 652051/2024 | Justice Andrea Masley | December 21, 2024**

The court granted a motion to compel a Filipino bank to collect and search documents from one of its in-house counsel despite the bank's claim that the information possessed by its lawyer would be privileged. The decision addresses the scope of discovery obligations for documents held by in-house counsel.

### B. Richmond Global Compass Fund Management GP, LLC v. Decio Nascimento
**Justice Andrew Borrok | March 5, 2024**

The court granted a motion to compel discovery and declassified certain information marked by defendants as "Attorneys' Eyes Only." The court concluded that defendants could not limit the provision of certain information solely to plaintiff's attorney, even where defendants claimed fear that plaintiff would use the information to tortiously interfere with defendants' business relations.

### C. Conca Tekiner Chelsea v. Yasemin Tekiner
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | December 4, 2024**

The court granted in part a motion to compel the production of documents in defendant's possession, regardless of whether the defendant possessed them in a "personal" capacity or from acting as a trustee. This decision clarifies that the capacity in which documents are held does not shield them from discovery.

### D. Law Office of Mark S. Helweil v. Karambelas
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | March 13, 2024**

The court denied, without prejudice, plaintiffs' motion to compel a deposition of defendant. The denial without prejudice suggests procedural deficiencies that could be cured in a renewed motion.

## IV. ESI AND DOCUMENT PRODUCTION

### A. Zuckerbrot v. Gellis Lande
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | March 6, 2024**

The court rejected defendant's claim that her production of "screenshots" of electronically stored information (ESI), rather than "native format ESI," from her social media accounts was sufficient. This decision reinforces the Commercial Division's expectation that ESI be produced in native format absent agreement or court order to the contrary.

### B. Novum Energy Trading Inc. v. Transmontaigne Operating Co. L.P.
**Index No. 655283/2023 | Justice Margaret A. Chan | August 27, 2024**

The court found all but one of defendant's eight Requests for Admission to be improper, striking them for seeking admission of disputed facts and ultimate issues. This decision provides guidance on the proper scope of Requests for Admission in commercial litigation.

---

## V. INTERNATIONAL DISCOVERY

### A. South32 Chile Copper Holdings Pty Ltd. v. Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd.
**Justice Robert R. Reed | 2024**

This decision addressed international discovery via the Hague Convention of 1970. The court explained that a litigant in the New York Commercial Division seeking pre-trial discovery from a non-party in a foreign jurisdiction can apply to the court for issuance of a "Letter of Request for Judicial Assistance" under the Convention, which has been signed by over 60 countries.

---

## VI. PRIVILEGE ISSUES

### A. Privilege Waiver Decision
**Justice Andrew Borrok | December 9, 2024**

The court held that a judgment debtor's public denial of fraud allegations in a press release "based on and in reliance on advice received from outside counsel" waived attorney-client privilege. This decision serves as a reminder that public statements referencing legal advice may result in privilege waiver.

---

## VII. KEY PROCEDURAL DEVELOPMENTS

### A. New Commercial Division Rule 11-h (Effective May 6, 2025)

The Chief Administrative Judge signed an administrative order adding a new Rule 11-h to the Commercial Division Rules, requiring that, at the outset of a case, parties serve initial discovery disclosures similar to what is currently required in federal practice under FRCP 26(a)(1).

---

## VIII. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Deposition Attendance is Mandatory:** Repeated failure to appear for court-ordered depositions will result in dismissal of claims (O'Rourke).

2. **Spoliation Has Consequences:** Claims of impossibility regarding document preservation will be scrutinized; parties must implement adequate litigation holds (Earthlink).

3. **AEO Designations May Be Challenged:** "Attorneys' Eyes Only" designations can be declassified where the designating party cannot demonstrate legitimate need (Richmond Global).

4. **Native Format ESI Required:** Screenshots of social media are insufficient; native format production is expected (Zuckerbrot).

5. **Privilege Can Be Waived by Public Statements:** Referencing counsel's advice in public communications may waive privilege (Borrok Dec. 2024 decision).

6. **Capacity Does Not Shield Documents:** Documents in a party's possession are discoverable regardless of the capacity in which they are held (Conca Tekiner).
