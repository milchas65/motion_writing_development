# Spoliation Sanctions Motion Arc

**Purpose:** Document the structure, progression, and lifecycle of spoliation sanctions motions from filing to decision.

---

## MOTION OVERVIEW

**What it is:** A motion seeking sanctions against a party that destroyed, altered, or failed to preserve evidence relevant to litigation.

**When brought:** After discovery reveals that evidence has been lost, destroyed, or spoliated.

**Relief sought:** Ranges from adverse inference instruction to case dismissal, depending on severity.

---

## LEGAL FRAMEWORK

### New York State
- **Statutory:** CPLR 3126 (penalties for refusal to comply with discovery)
- **Common Law:** Inherent power to sanction spoliation
- **Key Standard:** Party seeking sanctions must show (1) party with control over evidence had obligation to preserve it; (2) evidence was destroyed with "culpable state of mind"; (3) destroyed evidence was relevant to party's claim or defense

### Federal
- **Statutory:** FRCP 37(e) (amended 2015)
- **Inherent Power:** Courts retain inherent authority to sanction
- **Key Distinction:** FRCP 37(e) applies only to ESI; common law applies to tangible evidence
- **Prejudice Required:** Must show prejudice for curative measures; intent required for severe sanctions

## COURT ANALYSIS STRUCTURE

### Three-Prong Test (NY Courts)
Courts apply a three-prong spoliation test methodically, often with explicit subheadings in decisions:

| Prong | Court Analysis Pattern |
|-------|------------------------|
| **1. Obligation to Preserve** | "As to the first prong..." - Did party reasonably anticipate litigation at time of destruction? |
| **2. Culpable State of Mind** | "With respect to the second prong..." - Negligence? Gross negligence? Willfulness? |
| **3. Relevance** | "As to the third prong..." - Was destroyed evidence relevant to claims/defense? |

### Preservation Duty Triggers
- **General notice may be insufficient**: A broad preservation demand may not trigger duty for specific evidence types not mentioned
- **Complaint specificity matters**: Filing a complaint with specific allegations (e.g., "call center misconduct") can establish preservation duty for related evidence even if prior notice was too general
- **Key inquiry**: Did party "reasonably anticipate litigation" involving the specific evidence at issue?

### Sanctions Analysis Structure
After establishing spoliation elements, courts structure sanctions analysis as:
1. **Confirm elements satisfied** - Duty, culpability, relevance all established
2. **Assess prejudice** - What harm did spoliation cause to moving party?
3. **Evaluate culpability level** - Negligence vs. gross negligence vs. willfulness
4. **Determine appropriate remedy** - Match sanction to misconduct severity

## INSIGHTS FROM REVIEWED PACKAGES

### EarthLink v. Charter Communications (Index 654332/2020)
**Court:** NY Supreme, Commercial Division Part 48 (Hon. Andrea Masley)
**Decision:** January 18, 2024
**Result:** Spoliation sanctions GRANTED (adverse inference + preclusion + monetary)
**Spoliation Type:** ESI - Audio call recordings

**Key Arc Insights:**
1. **Three-prong test is sequential**: Court methodically addressed each element with structured subheadings
2. **Preservation duty specificity**: General preservation notice insufficient; complaint's specific call center allegations triggered duty to preserve call recordings
3. **Willfulness presumption**: When willful destruction established, relevance of destroyed evidence is presumed (*VOOM* doctrine)
4. **Tailored sanctions**: Court imposed combination of remedies matched to specific harms:
   - Adverse inference (for destroyed recordings' content)
   - Preclusion (defendant cannot characterize volume of problem calls)
   - Monetary sanctions (costs of pursuing phantom evidence)
