# Argument Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Reply)

## Purpose
Rebut opponent's defenses, highlight admissions, and reinforce that sanctions are warranted.

## Key Principles

### 1. Don't Repeat—Rebut
The reply responds to opposition arguments. Do not repeat your opening brief.

### 2. Highlight Admissions
Point out facts opponent admitted or failed to dispute.

### 3. Expose Gaps
Show what opponent failed to address or explain.

### 4. Stay Focused
Address only arguments opponent actually made.

## Structure

Use numbered rebuttals with italic emphasis:

```
ARGUMENT

I. [PARTY'S] DEFENSES FAIL

*First*, [Party] claims [defense], but [rebuttal with evidence].

*Second*, [Party] argues [defense], but [rebuttal with evidence].

*Third*, [Party] contends [defense], but [rebuttal with evidence].

II. THE REQUESTED SANCTIONS REMAIN APPROPRIATE
```

## Rebuttal Techniques

### Highlighting Admissions
> [Party] does not dispute that it received Plaintiff's preservation letter on March 15. (Opp. at 3.) [Party] also admits that the surveillance video was deleted on April 1. (Id. at 5.) These admissions establish both duty and destruction.

### Exposing Gaps
> Notably, [Party] offers no explanation for why its "litigation hold" failed to preserve the key documents at issue. The opposition is silent on this critical point.

### Rebutting Good Faith Claims
> [Party] claims it "implemented a litigation hold," but the record shows otherwise. [Party's] own IT manager testified that no hold was issued until [date]—two months after the preservation duty arose. (Smith Dep. 45:10-15.)

### Using Opponent's Evidence Against Them
> [Party's] claim that preservation was "impossible" is belied by [Party's] own production of 104,000 transcripts of the same calls. If [Party] could transcribe and retain the calls, it could preserve the recordings.

### Distinguishing Cases
> [Party's] reliance on [Case] is misplaced. In [Case], the court denied sanctions because the evidence was lost before any litigation was anticipated. Here, [Party] destroyed evidence after receiving a written preservation demand.

### Addressing New Evidence
> [Party] submits for the first time an affidavit from its IT manager. This late-filed affidavit does not save [Party's] case because [reasons].

## Concrete Evidence
Use specific statistics and sample evidence where available:
> EarthLink's review of 500 transcripts reveals: 35% include unintelligible sentences; only 30% refer to EarthLink; 25% appear to be only portions of calls; approximately 43,000 calls have no transcripts at all.

## What to Address
- Defenses opponent actually raised
- New facts or evidence in opposition
- Opponent's case distinctions
- Any concessions or admissions

## What NOT to Address
- Arguments opponent did not make
- Issues fully addressed in opening brief
- Tangential matters
- Personal attacks

## Length Discipline
- Reply should be significantly shorter than opening brief
- Example: 14 pages vs. 30 in opening
- Focus on rebuttal, not repetition
- No new background facts

## Conclusion
Keep brief—single sentence with specific relief:
> [Moving Party] respectfully requests that the Court impose spoliation sanctions, grant an adverse inference instruction, and award any other relief deemed just and proper.
