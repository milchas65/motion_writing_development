# Preliminary Statement Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Reply)

## Purpose
Frame opponent's concessions as admissions, preview your rebuttals, and reinforce why sanctions are warranted.

## Structure

Use a "confirms" framing to turn opponent's admissions against them:

```
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

[Party's] opposition confirms: (1) [admission one]; (2) [admission two]; (3) [admission three]. These admissions establish [elements] and warrant sanctions.

[Party's] counterarguments fail. [Brief preview of rebuttals.]
```

## Content Elements

### Opening: The "Confirms" Frame
- List facts opponent admitted or did not dispute
- Show how admissions satisfy spoliation elements
- State that sanctions are warranted

### Rebuttal Preview
- Briefly note why each defense fails
- Point to key evidence that defeats opponent's claims
- Keep to one paragraph—details in Argument

## Example (from EarthLink Reply)

> Charter's opposition confirms: (1) Charter deleted the audio recordings of customer calls; (2) Charter knew of its preservation obligations; (3) Charter failed to issue a litigation hold for call recordings. This establishes spoliation and mandates sanctions. Charter's counterarguments fail.
>
> First, Charter's claim that preservation was "impossible" is belied by its own production of 104,000 transcripts of the same calls. Second, those transcripts are not "better" evidence—EarthLink's sample review shows 35% contain unintelligible passages. Third, the burden of any uncertainty falls on Charter as the spoliator, not on EarthLink.
