# Statement of Facts Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Reply)

## Note
Reply briefs typically do not include a new Statement of Facts section. Facts were established in the opening brief.

## When to Address Facts in Reply
Address new or disputed facts only if opponent:
- Introduced new evidence or affidavits
- Materially misstated facts from the record
- Raised factual issues requiring correction

## How to Address

### New Evidence
> [Party] submits for the first time an affidavit from [witness]. This affidavit [does not change the analysis because / is contradicted by / fails to address] [reasons].

### Factual Corrections
> [Party] claims that [misstatement]. The record shows otherwise. [Citation to evidence.]

### Highlighting Admissions
> [Party] does not dispute [key fact]. (Opp. at __.) [Party] also admits [fact]. (Id. at __.)

## Placement
Factual disputes in reply briefs are typically addressed:
- In the Preliminary Statement (briefly)
- Within the Argument section (where relevant)
- Not in a separate Statement of Facts

## Length
Keep factual discussion minimal. Reply briefs should be significantly shorter than opening briefs.
