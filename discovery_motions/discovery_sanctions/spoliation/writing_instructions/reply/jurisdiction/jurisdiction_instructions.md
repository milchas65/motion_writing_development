# Jurisdiction Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Reply)

## Note
Reply briefs typically do not include a separate jurisdiction section. Jurisdictional authority was established in the opening brief.

## When to Address Jurisdiction in Reply
Only address if opponent:
- Challenged the court's authority to impose sanctions
- Raised procedural defenses
- Argued requested sanctions exceed statutory authority

If needed, address briefly in the Argument section by distinguishing opponent's cases and reaffirming applicable authority.
