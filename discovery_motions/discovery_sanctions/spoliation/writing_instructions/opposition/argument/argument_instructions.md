# Argument Section Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Opposition)

## Purpose

    A. Litigation Was Not Reasonably Anticipated at the Relevant Time

    B. [Alternatively] [Party] Had No Control Over the Evidence

II. NO CULPABLE STATE OF MIND EXISTS

    A. [Party] Implemented Appropriate Preservation Measures

    B. Any Loss Was Due to [Routine Practice/Technical Failure/Third Party]

III. THE ALLEGEDLY DESTROYED EVIDENCE WAS NOT RELEVANT

IV. MOVANT CANNOT ESTABLISH PREJUDICE

    A. Alternative Evidence Exists

    B. Movant Can Still Prove Its Claims

V. [IF NEEDED] IF ANY SANCTION IS WARRANTED, [LESSER SANCTION] IS APPROPRIATE
```

## Defense Strategies by Element

### Challenging Duty to Preserve

**No reasonable anticipation of litigation:**
- Litigation was speculative at the time
- No specific threat or demand existed
- Reasonable person would not have anticipated suit

**No control over evidence:**
- Evidence was in third party's possession
- Client did not create or maintain the evidence
- Evidence was beyond client's ability to preserve

**Duty was satisfied:**
- Litigation hold was implemented
- Relevant evidence was preserved
- Loss was of immaterial subset

### Challenging Culpable State of Mind

**Good faith efforts:**
- Litigation hold notice issued
- Employees instructed to preserve
- IT measures implemented
- Third-party vendors notified

**Routine destruction before duty:**
- Evidence destroyed before litigation anticipated
- Routine retention policy was followed
- No reason to suspect litigation at time of destruction

**Technical/accidental loss:**
- System failure
- Vendor error
- Unintentional deletion
- Corruption of data

**Third party responsibility:**
- Evidence was in vendor's control
- Destruction was by third party
- Client took reasonable steps

### Challenging Relevance

**Evidence not relevant:**
- Evidence did not pertain to claims at issue
- Evidence was cumulative of other evidence
- Evidence would not have affected outcome

**Speculation about contents:**
- Movant speculates about what evidence would show
- No basis to conclude evidence was unfavorable
- Evidence may have been neutral or favorable to movant

### Challenging Prejudice

**Alternative evidence exists:**
- Same information available from other sources
- Witnesses can testify to same facts
- Documents contain same information

**Case can still be proven:**
- Movant has sufficient evidence for claims
- Lost evidence was not critical
- Other discovery has been completed

**Prejudice can be cured:**
- Additional discovery can fill gaps
- Stipulations can address missing evidence
- Limiting instruction sufficient

## Arguing for Lesser Sanctions

If some sanction may be warranted, argue for the least severe:

| Instead of | Argue for |
|------------|-----------|
| Dismissal | Adverse inference |
| Adverse inference | Preclusion of specific evidence |
| Preclusion | Monetary sanctions |
| Monetary sanctions | Curative discovery |
| Any sanction | No sanction with warning |

## Point Headings

**Good (states conclusion with key fact):**
> I. NO SPOLIATION OCCURRED BECAUSE DEFENDANT ISSUED A LITIGATION HOLD WITHIN 48 HOURS OF RECEIVING THE COMPLAINT AND PRESERVED ALL RESPONSIVE DOCUMENTS

**Bad (states topic):**
> I. THE LITIGATION HOLD

## Handling Strong Facts Against You

### If Evidence Was Clearly Destroyed
- Explain circumstances
- Show lack of intent
- Demonstrate good faith efforts
- Argue for proportionate sanction

### If Duty Clearly Existed
- Focus on lack of culpability
- Show preservation efforts
- Emphasize limited prejudice

### If Some Culpability Exists
- Minimize degree of culpability
- Distinguish from intentional destruction
- Argue for lesser sanction

## INSIGHTS FROM REVIEWED PACKAGES

### EarthLink v. Charter Communications (Index 654332/2020)
**Opposition denied:** Court granted sanctions despite defense arguments

**Opposition Writing Techniques (from Charter MOL):**

**Scale/Impossibility Rhetoric:**
Heavy use of statistics to emphasize unreasonableness:
> "140 million recordings," "more than one billion minutes," "1,800 years of recordings," "10,000 gigabytes per day"

*Caution:* This technique backfired when movant showed actual scope was 130,000 calls, not 140 million. Don't exaggerate burden.

**Opposition Point Headings:**
Focus on what opponent FAILED to prove:
> "Charter Was Not Obligated to Preserve Every Call Recording..."
> "EarthLink Fails to Demonstrate Prejudice..."
> "EarthLink Has Not Suffered Cognizable Harm..."

**Direct Rebuttal Language:**
Short declarative sentences to confront movant's characterizations:
> "Not true."
> "To the contrary, Charter..."
> "This claim is belied by the record."

**What Arguments Failed:**
| Argument | Court's Response |
|----------|------------------|
| *Convolve* "heroic efforts" defense | Recordings not "ephemeral" - were captured and retained |
| *Thomas* burden argument | Rejected per *Pegasus* burden shift |
| "Alternative evidence is better" | Transcripts found inadequate |
| "Movant contributed by waiting" | Doesn't excuse spoliation |
