# Jurisdiction Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Opposition)

## Purpose
In opposition, jurisdictional arguments are rare but may be raised if:
- The court lacks authority to impose the requested sanctions
- The requested sanctions exceed statutory authority

## When to Raise Jurisdictional Issues
- Movant seeks sanctions beyond court's authority
- Procedural requirements not met (e.g., no prior order violated)
- Applicable rules don't authorize requested relief

## Content (if raising jurisdictional defense)

```
THE COURT LACKS AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE THE REQUESTED SANCTIONS

[Movant's] request for [specific sanction] exceeds this Court's authority under [applicable rule]. [Explanation of why sanctions are unauthorized.]
```

## Examples

**FRCP 37(e) Limitations:**
> Plaintiff seeks an adverse inference instruction under FRCP 37(e)(2), but that remedy is available only upon a showing that Defendant acted with "intent to deprive" Plaintiff of the evidence. Mere negligence—the most Plaintiff alleges—is insufficient.

**No Prior Order:**
> Plaintiff seeks sanctions under CPLR 3126, which authorizes penalties for "refusal to obey an order." Because no prior order compelled preservation of the specific documents at issue, CPLR 3126 does not apply.

## Note
Jurisdictional challenges to spoliation sanctions are uncommon. In most cases, the focus is on whether the elements of spoliation are satisfied rather than whether the court has authority to act.
