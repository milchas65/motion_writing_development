# Parties Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Opposition)

In opposition, party identification focuses on clarifying control issues and correcting any mischaracterizations by movant.

## When to Include
- Movant mischaracterized your client's role or control
- Third parties had custody of the evidence
- Corporate structure affects responsibility

## Content (if needed)

```
THE PARTIES

[If correcting movant's characterization:]
Contrary to Plaintiff's assertion, Defendant [did not have exclusive control / shared control with third party / etc.].

[If clarifying corporate relationships:]
While Plaintiff names [Parent Co] as Defendant, the [evidence at issue] was maintained by [Subsidiary], a separate corporate entity with its own document retention policies.
```

## Key Points for Opposition
- Clarify who actually controlled the evidence
- Note if third parties had custody
- Correct any mischaracterizations by movant

## Note
In most oppositions, party issues are addressed in the Statement of Facts or Argument rather than in a separate section.
