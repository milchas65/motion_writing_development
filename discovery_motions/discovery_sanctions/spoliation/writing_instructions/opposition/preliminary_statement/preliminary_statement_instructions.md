# Preliminary Statement Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Opposition)

## Purpose
Frame your defense, preview your strongest arguments, and explain why the motion should be denied.

## Structure

Use a "two-principal-reasons" structure when possible:

```
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

[Opening: State motion should be denied]

The motion should be denied for two principal reasons.

First, [strongest defense - typically no prejudice or alternative evidence exists].

Second, [secondary defense - no culpability, no duty, or proportionality].

[Closing: Note what client did do right, if applicable]
```

## Content Elements

### Opening
- State clearly that the motion should be denied
- Frame your client's conduct as reasonable
- Avoid being defensive or dismissive

### Two-Principal-Reasons Structure
**First reason**: Lead with your strongest defense
- Alternative evidence exists and is sufficient
- No actual prejudice resulted
- Movant can still prove their claims

**Second reason**: Secondary defense
- No duty to preserve the specific evidence
- Preservation was impossible or unreasonable
- No culpable state of mind

### Closing
- Acknowledge good faith efforts
- Note proportionality concerns if sanctions sought are severe

## Example (Opposition Structure)

> The motion for spoliation sanctions should be denied.
>
> First, EarthLink cannot demonstrate prejudice because Charter produced 104,000 transcripts of the same calls EarthLink claims were "destroyed." These transcripts are searchable, complete, and in many ways superior to audio recordings for litigation purposes.
>
> Second, even if some recordings were not preserved, Charter's conduct was at most negligent—not willful or contumacious. Charter received no specific preservation demand for audio recordings, and the scope of EarthLink's belated request—140 million calls—made complete preservation impracticable.
>
> Charter did implement a litigation hold upon receipt of the complaint and has produced millions of pages of documents in this litigation. The severe sanctions EarthLink seeks are wholly disproportionate to any harm.
