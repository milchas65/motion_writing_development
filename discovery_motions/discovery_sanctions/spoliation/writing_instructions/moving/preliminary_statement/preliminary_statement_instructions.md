## Example (from EarthLink v. Charter)

> This motion arises from Charter's willful spoliation of audio recordings of customer service calls. Despite receiving EarthLink's complaint—which specifically alleged misconduct by Charter's call center—Charter failed to issue a litigation hold for call recordings and continued its routine deletion of recordings that were critical to EarthLink's claims.
>
> Charter knew of its preservation obligation no later than September 2020, when EarthLink filed its complaint. Yet Charter did not implement a litigation hold for call recordings until confronted with EarthLink's spoliation motion two years later. By that time, Charter had deleted the vast majority of call recordings relevant to this litigation.
>
> EarthLink respectfully requests that the Court impose an adverse inference instruction, preclude Charter from introducing evidence on the content of the destroyed recordings, and award EarthLink its costs and fees in bringing this motion.
