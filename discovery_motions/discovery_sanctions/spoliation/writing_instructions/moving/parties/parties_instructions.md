# Parties Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Motion - Moving)

## Purpose
In spoliation motions, party identification is typically brief and focused on the relationship between the parties as it relates to the evidence at issue.

## When to Include a Separate Parties Section
- Complex multi-party litigation where not all parties are involved in the spoliation
- Need to establish who controlled the destroyed evidence
- Need to clarify corporate relationships (parent/subsidiary)

## When to Integrate into Statement of Facts
- Two-party litigation with straightforward relationships
- Party relationships are part of the spoliation narrative

## Content (if separate section needed)

```
THE PARTIES

[Moving Party] is [description]. [Moving Party] [relationship to evidence/claims].

[Responding Party] is [description]. At all relevant times, [Responding Party] had custody and control over [the destroyed evidence].
```

## Key Elements for Spoliation
- Focus on control: Who had custody/control of the evidence
- Focus on relationship: How parties' relationship relates to the evidence
- Keep brief unless party identity is contested

## Example

> Plaintiff EarthLink is a telecommunications provider that contracted with Charter to provide customer support services. Defendant Charter Communications is a cable and internet service provider that maintained a call center handling customer inquiries for EarthLink customers. At all relevant times, Charter had exclusive custody and control over the audio recordings of calls with EarthLink customers.

## Note
In most spoliation motions, parties are identified briefly in the Preliminary Statement or at the beginning of the Statement of Facts rather than in a separate section.
