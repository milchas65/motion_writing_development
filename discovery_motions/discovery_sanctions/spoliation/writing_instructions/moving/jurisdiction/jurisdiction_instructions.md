# Jurisdiction Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Motion - Moving)

## Purpose
Spoliation motions typically do not require a separate jurisdiction section because they are filed within existing litigation where jurisdiction has already been established.

## When Jurisdiction Section Is NOT Needed
- Motion filed in pending action where Court already has jurisdiction
- Standard spoliation motion under CPLR 3126 or FRCP 37(e)
- No novel jurisdictional issues

## When Jurisdiction Section MAY Be Needed
- Spoliation motion involves third party not already in the litigation
- Requesting sanctions against party over whom jurisdiction is contested
- Unique procedural posture (e.g., post-judgment discovery)

## Content (if needed)

```
JURISDICTION

This Court has jurisdiction to impose spoliation sanctions pursuant to [CPLR 3126 / FRCP 37(e) / the Court's inherent power]. The conduct at issue occurred during the pendency of this litigation and involves evidence directly related to [Moving Party's] claims.
```

## Jurisdictional Bases for Spoliation Sanctions

### New York State Court
- **CPLR 3126**: Penalties for refusal to comply with discovery order
- **Inherent power**: Court's authority to control litigation and sanction misconduct

### Federal Court
- **FRCP 37(e)**: Failure to preserve ESI
- **FRCP 37(b)**: Violation of discovery order
- **Inherent power**: Authority to sanction bad faith conduct

## Note
In most spoliation motions, jurisdictional authority is addressed briefly in the Legal Standard section of the Argument rather than as a standalone section.
