# Statement of Facts Instructions (Spoliation Sanctions Motion)

## Purpose
Present a chronological narrative establishing when the duty to preserve arose, what evidence existed, and how it was destroyed.

## Structure

Organize facts chronologically with thematic subheadings:

```

B. The Evidence That Existed and [Party's] Control Over It

C. [Party's] Failure to Preserve / Destruction of the Evidence

D. Discovery of the Spoliation

E. Prejudice to [Moving Party]
```

## Key Fact Categories

### A. Trigger for Preservation Duty
- Date litigation became reasonably anticipated
- What event triggered the duty (letter, complaint, incident)
- Evidence that party knew or should have known of duty
- Any preservation demands or litigation hold notices

### B. Evidence and Control

- How evidence was created and maintained
- Any policies regarding retention

### C. Destruction/Failure to Preserve
- What happened to the evidence
- When it was destroyed or lost
- Who was responsible
- What the party knew at the time
- Any policies violated

### D. Discovery of Spoliation
- When moving party learned of destruction
- How it was discovered (discovery, deposition, forensics)
- Spoliating party's response when confronted

### E. Prejudice
- What the evidence would have shown
- How its loss affects the case
- Why alternative evidence is inadequate

## Citation Practice

Every material fact should be supported by:
- Affidavit citations: (Smith Aff. ¶ 5)
- Exhibit citations: (Ex. A)
- Deposition citations: (Jones Dep. 34:5-12)
- Discovery response citations: (Def.'s Resp. to RFP No. 12)

## Tone

- Factual and objective in presentation
- Let facts demonstrate culpability
- Avoid argumentative characterizations in fact section
- Save conclusions for argument section

## What to Include

- Specific dates (not "around" or "approximately" when exact dates available)
- Specific names and titles of responsible individuals
- Exact quotes from relevant documents
- Technical details about evidence (format, storage, etc.)

## What NOT to Include

- Legal conclusions
- Argumentative characterizations
- Speculation about intent (save for argument)
- Irrelevant background

## INSIGHTS FROM REVIEWED PACKAGES

### EarthLink v. Charter Communications (Index 654332/2020)
**Motion granted:** Adverse inference + preclusion + monetary sanctions

**Factual Background Structure (from MOL in Support):**
Chronological with dated subheadings that anchor the narrative to a timeline:

```
FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. The Parties' Relationship (2010-2020)
   [Background establishing business relationship and context for claims]

B. EarthLink's Complaint and Preservation Demand (September 2020)
   [When duty to preserve arose]

C. Charter's Discovery Failures (March 2021-Present)
   [Timeline of concealment and continued deletion]

D. The Destroyed Call Recordings
   [What evidence was lost and its relevance]
```

**Key Technique:** Use specific dates throughout to establish the timeline that proves culpability:
- Date preservation duty triggered
- Date litigation hold should have been issued
- Date(s) evidence was destroyed
- Date spoliation was discovered
- Duration of concealment
