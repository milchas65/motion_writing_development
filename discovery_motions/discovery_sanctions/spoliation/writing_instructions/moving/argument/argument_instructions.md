```

## Element Analysis

### Element 1: Duty to Preserve

**When duty arises:**
- Receipt of preservation letter/litigation hold notice
- Filing of complaint or counterclaim
- Demand letter threatening litigation
- Incident giving rise to foreseeable claims
- Regulatory investigation

**What to show:**
- Specific date litigation became reasonably anticipated
- What triggered the duty
- What evidence was subject to preservation obligation

**Evidence types:**
- Preservation letters
- Complaint filing dates
- Correspondence showing dispute
- Incident reports

### Element 2: Destruction with Culpable Mind

**Levels of culpability (ascending):**
1. Negligence (failure to implement adequate preservation)
2. Gross negligence (reckless disregard for preservation duty)
3. Willfulness (intentional destruction)
4. Bad faith (destruction to deprive opponent of evidence)

**What to show:**
- Evidence existed and was destroyed
- Party's state of mind in destroying/failing to preserve
- Timing of destruction relative to duty
- Policies or practices that led to destruction

**Evidence types:**
- Forensic analysis
- Deposition testimony about destruction
- Document retention policies
- IT system logs
- Spoliation admissions

### Element 3: Relevance

**What to show:**
- What the destroyed evidence would have shown
- How it relates to claims or defenses at issue
- Why it cannot be obtained elsewhere

**Note on speculation:**
- Some inference about content is permissible
- Courts allow reasonable presumption that destroyed evidence was unfavorable

### Element 4: Prejudice

**What to show:**
- Specific prejudice from loss of evidence
- Impact on ability to prove/defend claims
- Whether alternative evidence exists
- Why prejudice cannot be cured

## Sanctions Analysis

### Matching Sanction to Misconduct

| Misconduct Level | Appropriate Sanction |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Negligence | Curative measures, costs |
| Gross negligence | Adverse inference, preclusion |
| Willfulness | Adverse inference, striking pleadings |
| Bad faith | Dismissal, default judgment |

### Arguing for Specific Sanctions

**Dismissal/Default:**
- Reserved for most egregious cases
- Must show willful, contumacious, or bad faith conduct
- Evidence destroyed was critical to case
- No lesser sanction would cure prejudice

**Adverse Inference:**
- Jury instructed to presume destroyed evidence was unfavorable
- Appropriate when relevance is established but content unknown
- More common than dismissal

**Preclusion:**
- Preclude spoliating party from introducing evidence on topic
- Appropriate when specific evidence category was destroyed

**Monetary Sanctions:**
- Costs of motion
- Costs of additional discovery to cure prejudice
- Attorney's fees

## Point Headings

**Good (states conclusion with key fact):**
> I. DEFENDANT HAD A DUTY TO PRESERVE THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEO BECAUSE IT RECEIVED PLAINTIFF'S WRITTEN PRESERVATION DEMAND WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE ACCIDENT

**Bad (states topic):**
> I. THE DUTY TO PRESERVE

## Handling Anticipated Defenses

### "Evidence Was Routinely Destroyed"
- Routine destruction does not excuse spoliation after duty attaches
- Failure to suspend routine destruction is itself culpable
- Cite cases rejecting this defense

### "No Prejudice Because Other Evidence Exists"
- Alternative evidence may not be equivalent
- Burden should not shift to non-spoliating party
- Destroyed evidence may have been more persuasive

### "No Intent to Destroy"
- For certain sanctions, negligence suffices
- Intent can be inferred from circumstances
- Willful blindness equals intent

## INSIGHTS FROM REVIEWED PACKAGES

### EarthLink v. Charter Communications (Index 654332/2020)
**Motion granted:** Adverse inference + preclusion + monetary sanctions

**Argument Structure (from MOL in Support):**
Mirror the three-prong legal test with Point Headings:
> "I. Charter Had a Duty to Preserve the Call Recordings"
> "II. Charter Acted With a Culpable State of Mind"
> "III. The Destroyed Recordings Are Relevant to EarthLink's Claims"

**Persuasive Repetition Technique:**
Build pattern of culpability through sentence structure:
> "Charter knew of its preservation obligation. Charter failed to issue a litigation hold. Charter continued to delete evidence. Charter concealed the destruction for two years."

**"To Be Clear" Constructions:**
Narrow scope to rebut anticipated "impossible" defense:
> "To be clear, EarthLink never demanded that Charter preserve all 140 million call recordings. Rather, EarthLink sought preservation of calls involving EarthLink customers—approximately 130,000 calls."

**Point Heading Style:**
Full-sentence declarative headings stating conclusion:
> "Charter's Willful Destruction of Evidence Warrants the Severe Sanctions of Adverse Inference and Issue Preclusion"

**Citation Practice:**
Lead with governing standard (*VOOM*), apply facts, then cite supporting cases in parenthetical string cites:
> "*see also Arbor Realty*, 140 AD3d at 608 (finding gross negligence where party failed to issue litigation hold); *Zubulake*, 220 FRD at 218 (duty to suspend auto-delete policy when litigation anticipated)"

**Effective Rebuttal of "Impossibility" Defense:**
Court rejected by pointing to spoliator's own partial compliance:
> "Charter's claim that it was 'impossible' to preserve the recordings is belied by its production of 104,000 transcripts of those same calls. Charter recorded, transcribed, and retained these calls—yet claims it could not preserve the audio recordings."
