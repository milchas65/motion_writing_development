## CASE PATTERNS

### Arguments That Win

**For Movant (Seeking Sanctions):**
- Cite *VOOM* for governing three-prong standard and willfulness presumption
- Lead with *VOOM*, apply facts, then use supporting cases in string cites
- Show pattern of spoliation across multiple cases (same party, same conduct) → establishes "knowing" vs. "negligent"
- Use *Pegasus* to shift relevance/prejudice burden to spoliator

**Pattern evidence strategy** (from EarthLink MOL): Cite other cases where same party sanctioned for same conduct:
> *Entm't One v. Charter* (Cal.), *Buckley Broadcasting v. Charter* (Ohio), *Integra Telecom v. Charter* (Or.)

### Arguments That Lose

**For Opponent (Defending):**
- *Thomas v. City of NY* burden argument → rejected per *Pegasus* burden shift
- *Convolve* "ephemeral data" defense → distinguished where evidence was recorded and retained before deletion
- "Heroic efforts" defense → fails when party had capability (partial production proves capability existed)

### Distinguishing Unfavorable Cases

| Unfavorable Case | How Distinguished | Effectiveness |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| *Convolve v. Compaq* | Evidence was "ephemeral" oscilloscope data vs. recorded/retained audio files | **EFFECTIVE** |
| *John Wiley & Sons v. Book Dog Books* | Preservation demand was "breathtakingly broad" vs. specific evidence type requested | **NEUTRAL** |
| *Louis Vuitton v. Dooney & Bourke* | No duty to "install equipment" for chat rooms vs. evidence already being captured | **NEUTRAL** |

## CASE CITATION STRATEGIES

### For Movant (Seeking Sanctions)

**Primary citation structure:**
1. Lead with *VOOM HD Holdings v. EchoStar*, 93 AD3d 33 (1st Dept 2012) - governing standard
2. Apply facts to *VOOM* framework
3. Support with string cites: "*see also* *Arbor Realty*, 140 AD3d at 608; *Zubulake*, 220 FRD at 218"
4. Use parentheticals to highlight favorable facts: *(imposing adverse inference where party continued deletion after receiving preservation notice)*

**Pattern evidence technique:**
Cite other cases sanctioning same party for same conduct → establishes "knowing" spoliation vs. "isolated mistake"

**Reply brief authority:**
- *Schozer* and *Betts* for best evidence rule preclusion
- *Pippins* for unilateral burden assessment prohibition
- *Baliotis* for opportunity-to-inspect requirement

### For Opponent (Opposing Sanctions)

**Primary defenses:**
| Case | Defense Supported |
|------|-------------------|
| *Convolve v. Compaq* | "Heroic efforts" not required; ephemeral data excused |
| *John Wiley & Sons v. Book Dog Books* | Overbroad preservation demand insufficient to trigger duty |
| *Louis Vuitton v. Dooney & Bourke* | No duty to install new equipment to preserve |
| *Distefano v. L. Offs. of Barbara H. Katsos* | Courts reluctant to find prejudice when info available from other sources |

**Caution:** These defenses were REJECTED in EarthLink. Distinguish on facts or avoid if similar circumstances.
