# Spoliation Sanctions Strategy Guide

**Purpose:** Tactical playbook for both movant (seeking sanctions) and opponent (defending against sanctions).

## MOVANT STRATEGY (Seeking Sanctions)

### Threshold Requirements to Establish

Before bringing the motion, ensure you can prove:

| Element | What You Need | Evidence Types |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Duty to Preserve** | Litigation was reasonably anticipated | Demand letters, complaints, preservation notices |
| **Control** | Spoliating party had control over evidence | Custody records, IT policies, testimony |
| **Destruction** | Evidence was actually destroyed/altered | Forensic reports, admissions, metadata |
| **Culpability** | Culpable state of mind (negligence to intent) | Policies violated, timing, cover-up evidence |
| **Relevance** | Destroyed evidence was relevant | Nature of claims, what evidence would show |
| **Prejudice** | Prejudice from inability to use evidence | Impact on ability to prove/defend claims |

### Timing Considerations

- **Bring motion after discovery reveals spoliation** - not on speculation
- **Document the concealment timeline** - how long opponent hid the spoliation
- **File promptly after discovery** - delay undermines urgency claims

### Evidence to Gather Before Filing

1. **Preservation demand documentation** - letters, notices, responses
2. **Discovery showing destruction** - interrogatory answers, deposition testimony, forensic reports
3. **Timeline evidence** - when duty triggered, when destruction occurred, when discovered
4. **Pattern evidence** - other cases sanctioning same party for same conduct
5. **Opponent's internal documents** - emails, policies showing knowledge of duty
6. **Prejudice evidence** - what can't be proven without destroyed evidence

### Strongest Arguments

| Strategy | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Pattern evidence** | Cite other cases where same party sanctioned for same conduct → establishes "knowing" vs. "negligent" spoliation | EarthLink MOL |
| **Narrow the demand** | Emphasize what was NOT requested (all calls) vs. what WAS requested (specific customer calls) → rebuts "impossibility" defense | EarthLink MOL |
| **Timeline building** | Build chronology: duty triggered → no hold → continued deletion → concealment - each step compounds culpability | EarthLink MOL |
| **Tailored sanctions** | Request specific relief tied to specific harms - don't overreach | EarthLink MOL |
| **Quote admissions** | Use opponent's own documents, emails, prior court filings against them | EarthLink MOL |
| **Preemptive rebuttal** | Address "impossibility" and "no prejudice" defenses in opening brief | EarthLink MOL |
| **Partial compliance undercuts** | If opponent produced some evidence, proves capability to preserve - undercuts "impossible" claim | EarthLink Decision |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't overreach on sanctions** - request proportionate relief
2. **Don't wait too long** - explain any delay in bringing motion
3. **Don't ignore alternative evidence** - address whether prejudice can be cured
4. **Don't rely on speculation** - prove destruction with evidence
5. **Don't miss pattern evidence** - check for other cases against same party

## OPPONENT STRATEGY (Defending Against Sanctions)

### Defense Categories

| Defense Type | Argument | Evidence Needed |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| **No Duty** | Litigation not reasonably anticipated | Timeline, lack of notice |
| **No Control** | Client didn't control evidence | Third-party custody, IT architecture |
| **No Destruction** | Evidence still exists or was never created | Discovery responses, forensic analysis |
| **No Culpability** | Good faith / routine destruction | Document retention policies, litigation hold |
| **No Relevance** | Evidence not relevant to claims | Scope of claims, alternative evidence |
| **No Prejudice** | Other evidence available | Alternative sources, stipulations |

### Mitigation Arguments

| Defense | Description | Effectiveness (EarthLink) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Alternative evidence** | Substitute evidence is "better" (e.g., text-searchable transcripts vs. audio) | **FAILED** - Court found transcripts inadequate |
| **Impossibility/burden** | Preservation would require new infrastructure, millions in costs | **FAILED** - Partial production proved capability |
| **Good faith** | Promptly issued hold, preserved other ESI, notified when found alternative | **PARTIALLY ACCEPTED** - Reduced severity but sanctions still granted |
| **Proportionality** | Requested sanctions disproportionate to harm | **ACCEPTED** - Court granted "least harsh" inference |

### Timing Defenses

- **Destruction before duty** - Evidence deleted before litigation reasonably anticipated
- **Routine retention policy** - Followed normal document retention; not targeted destruction
- **No specific notice** - Preservation demand was too broad to trigger duty for specific evidence
- **Delayed discovery** - Couldn't have known evidence existed or was relevant

### Evidence Preservation Defenses

| Defense | Supporting Argument | Counter (from EarthLink) |
|---------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Implemented hold** | Issued litigation hold; instructed employees | Must prove hold actually preserved the evidence at issue |
| **Third-party control** | Evidence in vendor's possession | Doesn't excuse if party could have directed preservation |
| **Technical impossibility** | Storage infrastructure didn't exist | Fails if partial production shows capability existed |
| **Regulatory constraints** | Privacy laws (e.g., Cable Act) prevented retention | Must show actual legal prohibition, not preference |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't exaggerate burden** - "140 million recordings" when issue involves 130,000 calls undermines credibility
2. **Don't delay disclosure** - Late discovery of alternative evidence looks like concealment
3. **Don't blame movant** - "They didn't specify" defense fails if complaint made allegations specific
4. **Don't rely solely on alternative evidence** - Show it's truly equivalent, not just "better than nothing"
5. **Don't ignore pattern evidence** - If same party sanctioned elsewhere, distinguish rather than ignore

## SANCTIONS SPECTRUM

| Sanction Level | When Appropriate | Movant Should Seek When | Opponent Should Argue For |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Dismissal/Default** | Willful, egregious, bad faith | Intentional destruction of critical evidence | Never; argue any other sanction |
| **Adverse Inference** | Intentional or grossly negligent | Cannot prove case element without evidence | Least severe appropriate remedy |
| **Preclusion** | Evidence would have been helpful | Specific evidence categories destroyed | Narrowly tailored to affected evidence |
| **Monetary Sanctions** | Negligent, some prejudice | Costs incurred due to spoliation | Alternative to harsher sanctions |
| **Curative Measures** | Minimal culpability | Additional discovery to cure prejudice | Sufficient to address any harm |

---

## BURDEN DYNAMICS

### Initial Burden (Movant)
- Must establish three-prong test: duty, culpable state of mind, relevance
- Must show specific evidence was destroyed
- Must show prejudice from loss (unless willfulness shifts burden)

### Shifting Burden (Opponent)
- Once willful destruction established, burden shifts to spoliator to prove:
  - Destroyed evidence was not relevant (*Pegasus*)
  - No prejudice resulted from loss
  - Secondary evidence adequately represents destroyed original (*Schozer*)
- "Burden of the unknown" falls on spoliator, not movant

### Rebuttal (Movant)
**In Reply Brief:**
- Turn opposition's concessions into "admissions confirming spoliation"
- Scale correction - rebut inflated burden numbers with actual figures
- Attack substitute evidence quality with specifics (% unintelligible, % incomplete)
- Invoke "opportunity to inspect" requirement - spoliator can't unilaterally decide burden
- Best evidence rule - spoliator cannot use secondary evidence to prove destroyed contents

---

## WINNING ARGUMENT COMBINATIONS

### For Movant (EarthLink pattern)
1. **Clear duty trigger** - Complaint with specific allegations establishing preservation duty
2. **No litigation hold** - Evidence that opponent failed to issue hold or hold was ineffective
3. **Continued deletion** - Proof that deletion continued after duty arose
4. **Concealment** - Timeline showing opponent hid destruction for extended period (2 years in EarthLink)
5. **Pattern evidence** - Other cases sanctioning same party for same conduct
6. **Quantified prejudice** - Specific percentages showing substitute evidence inadequacy

### For Opponent (Successful Mitigation)
1. **Good faith efforts** - Documentation of hold, notifications, reasonable steps
2. **Proportionality** - Argue for least severe appropriate sanction
3. **Alternative evidence** - Show equivalent information available from other sources
4. **Scope challenge** - Preservation demand too broad to trigger specific duty

---

## LOSING ARGUMENT PATTERNS

### For Opponent (Failed in EarthLink)
| Argument | Why It Failed |
|----------|---------------|
| "Preservation was impossible" | Partial production (104K transcripts) proved capability |
| "Alternative evidence is better" | Court found transcripts inadequate (unintelligible, incomplete) |
| "Movant didn't specify recordings" | Complaint's call center allegations triggered duty |
| "Burden on movant to show prejudice" | Rejected - burden shifts to spoliator per *Pegasus* |
| "Isolated incident" | Pattern evidence from other jurisdictions proved knowing conduct |

---

## EVIDENCE THAT MATTERS MOST

### For Movant

1. **Preservation notices** - Written demands with dates
2. **Discovery concealment** - Responses falsely denying evidence existed
3. **Timeline documentation** - When duty arose vs. when destruction occurred
4. **Pattern evidence** - Other sanctions against same party
5. **Sample analysis** - Quantified deficiencies in substitute evidence (EarthLink: 500-call sample showing 35% unintelligible)
6. **Opponent's own documents** - Internal emails, policies showing knowledge

### For Opponent

1. **Litigation hold documentation** - When issued, to whom, what preserved
2. **Infrastructure evidence** - Technical impossibility of preservation
3. **Regulatory constraints** - Legal barriers to retention
4. **Alternative evidence quality** - Why substitute is equivalent or better
5. **Proportionality evidence** - Why requested sanctions are excessive

## INSIGHTS FROM REVIEWED PACKAGES

### EarthLink v. Charter Communications (Index 654332/2020)
**Court:** NY Supreme, Commercial Division Part 48 (Hon. Andrea Masley)
**Decision:** January 18, 2024
**Result:** Sanctions GRANTED (adverse inference + preclusion + monetary)

**What Won (Movant):**
- Pattern evidence citing other sanctions against same party in other jurisdictions
- Detailed timeline showing duty → no hold → continued deletion → concealment
- Quantified sample analysis of substitute evidence deficiencies
- Specific tailored sanctions tied to specific harms
- Best evidence rule argument in reply

**What Failed (Opponent):**
- "Impossibility" defense undercut by partial production (104K transcripts)
- "Alternative evidence is better" rejected - transcripts found inadequate
- Burden exaggeration ("140 million" vs. actual 130,000) hurt credibility
- Late disclosure of alternative evidence looked like concealment

**Key Tactical Insight:** The movant's sample review of 500 transcripts with specific percentages (35% unintelligible, 30% missing references, 25% incomplete) was powerful evidence that substitute evidence was inadequate. Quantify deficiencies whenever possible.
