**RE:** New York State Court Decisions — Motions to Strike

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum summarizes publicly available New York state court decisions on motions to strike, including motions under CPLR 3126 (discovery sanctions), CPLR 3024 (scandalous or prejudicial matter), motions to strike jury demands, and motions to strike notes of issue. The memorandum covers recent case law from 2023-2024 and outlines the applicable legal standards.

---

## II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

### A. CPLR 3126 — Discovery Sanctions (Striking Pleadings)

CPLR 3126 provides that when a party or its representative refuses to obey a discovery order or "willfully" fails to disclose information that the court finds "ought to have been disclosed," the court may issue an order:

1. Deeming issues related to the requested information resolved in favor of the party obtaining the order;
2. Prohibiting the recalcitrant party from "supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses"; or
3. **Striking out pleadings or parts thereof**, or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party.

**Standard:** The striking of a pleading is considered a "drastic remedy" requiring a clear showing that the failure to comply with discovery demands or court-ordered discovery is **willful and contumacious**. The willful and contumacious character of a party's conduct can be inferred from the party's repeated failure to comply with discovery demands or orders without a reasonable excuse.

*See Guardado v. K.B.G Commercial, Inc.*, 209 A.D.3d 721, 722 (2d Dep't 2022) (extent of penalties under CPLR 3126 "generally left to the court's discretion").

### B. CPLR 3024(b) — Motion to Strike Scandalous or Prejudicial Matter

CPLR 3024(b) provides that a party may move to strike any **scandalous or prejudicial matter unnecessarily inserted in a pleading**.

**Timing:** A notice of motion under this rule shall be served within twenty days after service of the challenged pleading. However, untimeliness is not necessarily a bar to the motion.

**Standard:** Whether to strike allegedly scandalous or prejudicial matter is left to the discretion of the trial court. The key inquiry is whether the purportedly scandalous or prejudicial allegations are **relevant to a cause of action**. If the item would be admissible at trial under the evidentiary rules of relevancy, its inclusion in the pleading would not justify a motion to strike.

**Definitions:**
- Material is **scandalous** "if it is both immaterial and reproachful or capable of producing harm without justification." *Dong Wook Park v. Michael Parke Dori Grp., Inc.*, 12 Misc. 3d 1182(A) (Sup. Ct. Nassau Cty. 2006).
- "Matter which is merely unnecessary should not be stricken from a pleading unless it is first shown to be scandalous or prejudicial." *Pisula v. Roman Catholic Archdiocese of N.Y.*, 201 A.D.3d 88, 99 (2d Dep't 2021).

### C. CPLR 3211(b) — Motion to Dismiss Affirmative Defenses

CPLR 3211(b) provides that "a party may move for judgment dismissing one or more defenses on the ground that a defense is not stated or has no merit."

**Standard:** The standard of review is akin to that applied under CPLR 3211(a)(7)—i.e., whether there is any legal or factual basis for the assertion of the defense. The allegations set forth in the answer must be liberally construed and viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant.

### D. CPLR 4102 — Jury Demand

Under CPLR 4102(a), a party may demand a trial by jury by serving upon all other parties and filing a note of issue containing a demand for trial by jury.

**Standard for Striking:** A jury demand may be struck where the party has contractually waived the right to a jury trial, or where the claims at issue are purely equitable in nature.

### E. 22 NYCRR 202.21 — Note of Issue

A motion to vacate a note of issue and certificate of readiness must be made within **20 days** of filing. After 20 days, the motion will be granted only where "a material fact in the certificate of readiness is incorrect" or upon "good cause shown."

## III. CASE DECISIONS — CPLR 3126 (DISCOVERY SANCTIONS)

### A. Pleadings STRUCK

#### 1. Five Star Electric Corp. v. The Trustees of Columbia University

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 655947/2018 |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Joel M. Cohen |
| **Date** | September 30, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Complaint **STRUCK**; Action Dismissed |

**Facts:** The case arose from a construction dispute related to a new Columbia University building. Defendants moved to strike plaintiff's complaint under CPLR 3126 based on discovery violations.

Five Star Electric had "willfully failed to provide discovery as directed" despite three separate court orders issued between January 2021 and September 2021. The plaintiff ignored interrogatory responses due June 8 and August 11, 2020, with non-compliance lasting approximately four years—roughly two-thirds of the litigation's six-year duration.

**Holding:** The court rejected plaintiff's excuse that ESI search terms were needed, noting the company could have searched its own records. The court emphasized that the "strong public policy preference" for deciding cases on the merits "equally allow courts" to impose sanctions when discovery violations are willful and contumacious.

**Key Factors:**
- Prejudice included stale evidence, lost witness availability, and institutional knowledge loss
- Belated supplemental response submitted during the motion hearing could not cure years of unexplained delay

#### 2. O'Rourke v. Hammerstein Ballroom/Manhattan Studios Inc.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Margaret Chan |
| **Date** | August 1, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Complaint **STRUCK**; Action Dismissed |

**Facts:** Between November 2021 and January 2024, the court held eight discovery conferences and scheduled the plaintiff's deposition at each one. The plaintiff failed to appear for all eight court-ordered depositions.

**Timeline:**
- May 1, 2024: Ninth discovery conference; plaintiff's counsel cited "extrinsic issues"
- June 28, 2024: Court-ordered deposition date; plaintiff failed to appear again
- July 10, 2024: Status conference; court gave final deadline before motion return date
- August 1, 2024: Plaintiff filed opposition instead of appearing for deposition

**Holding:** Justice Chan found the repeated non-compliance demonstrated "gamesmanship" and "lackadaisical handling" warranting "the drastic sanction" of dismissal under CPLR 3126(3).

**Key Takeaway:** The Commercial Division will enforce a strict, no-tolerance approach in disposing of cases for willful discovery violations. A party's repeated negligence will meet the criterion to strike a pleading.

#### 3. Kaiping Hong-Ri Garment Co. Ltd. v. Goldfarb

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2023 NY Slip Op 32459(U) |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Joel M. Cohen |
| **Date** | July 10, 2023 |
| **Ruling** | Answer **STRUCK**; Default Judgment Entered |

**Facts:** Defendants failed to comply with the court's discovery orders.

**Holding:** The court struck defendants' answer and entered a default judgment because of defendants' failure to comply with the court's discovery orders.

---

#### 4. Herman v. Herman

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2015 NY Slip Op. 31205(U) |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Shirley Werner Kornreich |
| **Date** | July 13, 2015 |
| **Ruling** | Defendant's Answer and Counterclaims **STRUCK** |

**Facts:** By the time of the decision, the defendant brother had established a long history of violating discovery orders. He and his lawyer had lied about the extent of searches they had made for e-mails, and he had deleted e-mails.

**Holding:** The court granted the motion to strike, characterizing the defendant as "incorrigible."

**Factors Considered:**
1. Whether the conduct prejudiced the plaintiff by impeding its ability to obtain true discovery and forcing plaintiff to spend enormous amounts of money and time to prove the case
2. Whether misconduct was not isolated and defendants did not attempt to correct it
3. Whether, in considering a lesser sanction, the court concluded that the wrongdoing would continue if the lawsuit was allowed to proceed

---

### B. Motion to Strike DENIED

#### 5. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Evanson

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2024 N.Y. Slip Op. 04367 |
| **Court** | Second Department |
| **Date** | September 11, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike Complaint **DENIED** (Affirmed) |

**Facts:** In this mortgage foreclosure action, defendant moved to strike the complaint pursuant to CPLR 3126 for failing to "substantively comply with the requirements of 22 NYCRR 202.7 and 202.20-f(b)."

**Holding:** The Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's denial. There was no indication that defendant's counsel made any effort to confer with the lender's counsel to resolve the discovery dispute, nor did defendant move to compel disclosure. Instead, defendant moved directly to strike the complaint.

**Key Takeaway:** Before seeking the drastic remedy of striking a pleading, a party must follow requisite procedures, including conferring with opposing counsel and moving to compel.

---

#### 6. Maple Drake Austell Owner, LLC v. D.F. Pray, Inc.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Robert R. Reed |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike **DENIED** |

**Holding:** Justice Reed denied a motion to strike on the basis that defendant "failed to comply with this court's explicit rules...[by] never submitt[ing] a letter to the court outlining any of the discovery disputes."

---

## IV. CASE DECISIONS — CPLR 3024 (SCANDALOUS/PREJUDICIAL MATTER)

### A. Motion GRANTED (in whole or part)

#### 7. Ganieva v. Black

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2023 NY Slip Op 02380 |
| **Court** | First Department (reversing Supreme Court, NY County) |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike **GRANTED** on Appeal |

**Facts:** The trial court denied defendant's motion pursuant to CPLR 3024(b) to strike certain factual allegations from the first amended complaint.

**Holding:** On appeal, the First Department reversed, holding that the trial court should have granted the motion to strike certain inflammatory factual allegations, including allegations that employed rhetoric or detailed defendant's misconduct toward other women.

The allegations at issue were found to be **scandalous and prejudicial**, and not necessary to establish any element of plaintiff's causes of action.

**Key Principle:** CPLR 3024(b) motions do not judge whether matters will be discoverable or admissible at trial; the focus is on whether the matter is necessary to the pleading.

---

#### 8. Mangone v. Brown Harris Stevens Dev. Mktg., LLC

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2024 NY Slip Op 51236(U) |
| **Court** | NY Supreme Court |
| **Date** | 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Motion **GRANTED in part, DENIED in part** |

**Facts:** This action arose from the alleged failure of defendant to pay plaintiff contractually mandated severance pay. Defendant moved under CPLR 3024 to strike two categories of allegations from plaintiff's complaint.

**Holding:**
- **GRANTED:** The court struck paragraphs describing defendant's effort to resolve plaintiff's severance claim, finding they constituted a description of settlement negotiations subject to being stricken under CPLR 3024(b) and CPLR 4547 (citing *Soumayah*).
- **DENIED:** Paragraphs asserting legal arguments rather than pleading facts were not stricken because defendant did not show these paragraphs were "either scandalous or prejudicial, as required to obtain relief under CPLR 3024(b)."

---

### B. Motion DENIED

#### 9. S.S. v. Diocese of Brooklyn

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 523927/2019 |
| **Court** | NY Supreme Court, Kings County |
| **Date** | February 5, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike "Scandalous" Language **DENIED** |

**Facts:** Defendants sought to strike language pertaining to the history of concealment of alleged priest sexual abuse.

**Holding:** The court denied the motion, ruling the language was pertinent to the claims and thus not subject to being stricken.

---

#### 10. Cassissi v. Yee

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2014 NY Slip Op 24330 |
| **Court** | NY Supreme Court |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike **DENIED** |

**Facts:** Defendants invoked CPLR 3024(b) but did not identify any material in plaintiffs' complaint that was either scandalous or prejudicial.

**Holding:** The failure to identify scandalous or prejudicial material was "fatal to their motion." The court ruled that "in the absence of specific allegations that are either scandalous or prejudicial and irrelevant to Plaintiffs' claims, the CPLR does not support striking any portion of Plaintiffs' pleading solely on the basis of verbosity."

**Key Takeaway:** Verbosity alone is insufficient to warrant striking a pleading under CPLR 3024(b).

---

## V. CASE DECISIONS — MOTIONS TO STRIKE JURY DEMANDS

### A. Motion DENIED

#### 11. Khan v. Garg

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 652334/2013 |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Andrea Masley |
| **Date** | April 9, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike Jury Demand **DENIED** |

**Facts:** Defendants argued that plaintiff's jury demand was late and should have been demanded in the complaint.

**Holding:** The court explained that while plaintiff filed the Note of Issue late and admittedly lost track of the filing deadline for summary judgment, it rejected defendants' argument. In New York, the procedure is that the jury demand is to be filed with the Note of Issue (CPLR 3402; CPLR 4102(a)), and it need **not** be demanded in the complaint as defendants insisted.

---

### B. Motion GRANTED

#### 12. People v. National Rifle Association of America

| | |
|---|---|
| **Court** | First Department (affirming Supreme Court, NY County) |
| **Date** | 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike Jury Demand **GRANTED** (as to equitable relief) |

**Facts:** The NRA sought a jury trial on issues related to equitable relief sought by the Attorney General.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court granted plaintiff's motion to strike the NRA's jury demand to the extent it sought a jury trial of issues related to equitable relief. The First Department unanimously affirmed, finding the court properly denied the NRA's request to submit issues bearing on equitable remedies to the jury. Submitting those issues to the jury would raise numerous practical problems.

**Key Principle:** Issues of equitable relief are generally tried to the court, not a jury.

---

#### 13. Yao Wen Lei v. Yu Hin Chan

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2024 NY Slip Op 51204(U) |
| **Court** | Appellate Term, Second Department |
| **Date** | August 30, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Strike Jury Demand **GRANTED** (Affirmed) |

**Facts:** Both leases at issue contained jury waiver clauses.

**Holding:** The Civil Court properly granted the motion to strike tenants' jury demand, and upon reargument, properly adhered to its prior determination, as both leases contained **enforceable jury waiver clauses**.

---

## VI. CASE DECISIONS — MOTIONS TO STRIKE NOTES OF ISSUE

#### 14. Minckler v. D'Ella, Inc.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2024 NY Slip Op 00017 |
| **Court** | Third Department |
| **Date** | January 4, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Order **REVERSED**; Motion to Strike Note of Issue **GRANTED** |

**Facts:** On October 14, 2022, defendants filed a motion to strike the note of issue and/or for an independent medical examination, which was held in abeyance on consent while the parties waited for the Justice's ruling on a recusal issue.

**Holding:** The order was reversed, on the law, without costs, motion granted, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings before a different judge.

---

## VII. OTHER MOTIONS TO STRIKE

#### 15. Motion to Strike Interrogatory Responses

| | |

| **Ruling** | Motion **GRANTED in part** |

**Holding:** Justice Masley granted, in part, a motion to strike interrogatory responses that included calculations of damages foreclosed by prior court rulings.

---

#### 16. People v. Ward

| | |

**Facts:** The defendant filed a motion seeking to strike the People's Certificate of Compliance and Statement of Readiness in a criminal case.

**Holding:** The motion to strike the Certificate of Compliance and Statement of Readiness was denied.

## XI. CONCLUSION

Motions to strike in New York state courts are subject to varying standards depending on the statutory basis. Under CPLR 3126, courts require a showing of "willful and contumacious" conduct before imposing the "drastic remedy" of striking a pleading for discovery violations. Under CPLR 3024(b), movants must identify specific allegations that are both scandalous or prejudicial and irrelevant to the claims. Recent case law demonstrates that courts will impose severe sanctions for repeated discovery violations but require strict procedural compliance before doing so.
