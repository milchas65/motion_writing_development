**RE:**      Recent New York State Court Decisions on Deposition Disputes

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum summarizes recent decisions from New York State courts addressing deposition disputes. The cases cover issues including failure to appear, remote versus in-person depositions, time limit extensions, speaking objections, deposition misconduct, non-party subpoenas, and apex depositions of corporate executives.

---

## II. COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 1. O'Rourke v. Hammerstein Ballroom
**Justice Margaret A. Chan | August 22, 2024**

Between November 19, 2021, and January 24, 2024, the court held eight discovery conferences with the parties and scheduled the plaintiff's deposition each time. However, the plaintiff failed to appear for each of his eight separate court-ordered depositions.

During a conference, plaintiff's counsel advised the court that certain "extrinsic issues" caused him and his firm to "continuously drop the ball." The court ordered the plaintiff to appear for a deposition and gave defendants permission to file for sanctions should plaintiff fail to appear.

**Holding:** The court dismissed plaintiff's complaint as a sanction under CPLR 3126.

**Key Ruling:** "The sanction befitting the lackadaisical handling of this case is dismissal of plaintiff's complaint." The Commercial Division will enforce a "strict, no-tolerance approach in disposing of cases for willful discovery violations."

**Significance:** This decision demonstrates that repeated failure to appear for court-ordered depositions, even with counsel's admission of fault, will result in case-dispositive sanctions.

---

#### 2. DOIT Hospitality Del. LLC v. Reuben Bros. Ltd.
**Justice Robert R. Reed | 2024**

A party sought to conduct a deposition remotely rather than in person.

**Holding:** The motion for a remote deposition was denied.

**Key Rulings:**
- Under Commercial Division Rule 37, the court may order a remote deposition upon (1) consent of the parties, or (2) a motion showing good cause
- Absent mutual consent, the proponent of a remote deposition bears a "substantial burden" in establishing good cause
- Where the witness's testimony is "integral to the case," a higher threshold applies

**Factors for Good Cause Determination:**
- Distance between parties and witness, including time and costs of travel
- Whether the witness is a party to the litigation
- Importance or significance of the witness's testimony to the claims and defenses

**Significance:** Despite the prevalence of remote depositions post-COVID, courts will require in-person attendance for important witnesses absent a showing of good cause.

---

#### 3. Sumec Textile & Light Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zee Co. Apparel Corp.
**2024 NY Slip Op 51306(U) | Supreme Court, New York County | September 19, 2024**

A non-resident plaintiff sought to have their deposition conducted virtually rather than in person in New York.

**Holding:** The motion court held that plaintiff was unable to demonstrate hardship sufficient to have the deposition conducted virtually.

**Key Ruling:** Just because a plaintiff resides outside New York does not mean they cannot be compelled to personally appear for a deposition within the state.

**Significance:** Non-resident parties should not assume they are entitled to remote depositions; they must demonstrate specific hardship to avoid in-person appearance.

---

#### 4. KBL Group Case
**Commercial Division | 2024**

This case involved deposition misconduct and the court's response to discovery disputes.

**Holding:** The court exercised restraint but issued a strong warning.

**Key Rulings:**
- Commercial Division Rule 14 provides that "discovery disputes are preferred to be resolved through court conference as opposed to motion practice"
- Courts have broad discretion to fashion remedies for deposition misconduct, including the drastic sanction of striking the offending party's pleading
- Failure to abide by discovery orders will result in sanctions, "potentially including case-dispositive sanctions"

**Significance:** Courts prefer to resolve deposition disputes through conference rather than motion practice, but will impose severe sanctions for continued non-compliance.

---

#### 5. Law Office of Mark S. Helweil v. Karambelas
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | March 13, 2024**

The plaintiffs moved to compel a deposition of the defendant.

**Holding:** Motion to compel denied without prejudice.

**Significance:** Procedural deficiencies in a motion to compel deposition may result in denial without prejudice, allowing the movant to cure defects and refile.

---

## III. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. Second Department

#### 6. Wanliss v. Retina Assoc. of N.Y., P.C.
**2024 NY Slip Op 04478 | Second Department | September 18, 2024**

The plaintiff moved to extend a deposition that had already proceeded for more than 10 hours.

**Holding:** The Second Department affirmed the trial court's denial of plaintiff's motion.

**Key Rulings:**
- Plaintiff did not demonstrate "good cause" to extend the time limit
- The transcript did not show any significant delay caused by improper conduct or obstruction
- Plaintiff did not show that seven hours was insufficient under the circumstances

**Significance:** Extensions of the seven-hour deposition limit require a showing of good cause, including evidence of obstruction or other circumstances justifying additional time.

---

#### 7. Matter of Wolman
**Second Department | January 24, 2024**

This attorney disciplinary matter arose from misconduct at a remote videotaped deposition held on September 17, 2021.

**Findings:** The respondent attorney's conduct in questioning a plaintiff's witness was "knowing and intentional." The presiding judge noted that the "deponent was mistreated and that this deposition conduct has a potential chilling effect on other witnesses."

**Holding:** Disciplinary action imposed for deposition misconduct.

**Significance:** Attorney misconduct during depositions may result in professional discipline, particularly where the conduct is knowing and intentional.

---

#### 8. Slapo v. Winthrop Univ. Hosp.
**Second Department | 2024**

The court reviewed deposition conduct by defense attorneys.

**Holdings:**
- Defense attorneys violated 22 NYCRR § 221.1 by making numerous speaking objections
- The witness (Brem) violated 22 NYCRR § 221.2 by refusing to answer questions

**Key Ruling:** Speaking objections and improper refusals to answer violate the Uniform Rules for Depositions and may result in sanctions.

---

### B. Third Department

#### 9. Matter of Renna
**Third Department | March 14, 2024**

This attorney disciplinary matter involved the use of altered photo packs during a witness deposition.

**Findings:** The court had "significant concerns about respondent's defense that, as a practicing attorney with 10 years of experience in criminal law, she was unaware of case law prohibiting the use of altered photo packs" in witness depositions.

**Holding:** The court censured the respondent "to protect the public, maintain the honor and integrity of the profession, and deter others from engaging in similar misconduct."

**Significance:** Attorneys must be familiar with rules governing deposition conduct; ignorance of well-established prohibitions is not a defense.

---

## IV. OTHER TRIAL COURT DECISIONS

#### 10. J.R. v. V.M.
**2024 NY Slip Op 50039(U)**

Defendant's counsel filed an Order to Show Cause seeking an order compelling plaintiff to sit for a further deposition to answer questions that her attorney directed her not to answer, with the further deposition to be at plaintiff's counsel's expense due to his thwarting of the initial deposition.

**Plaintiff's Position:** Counsel opposed the relief, asserting it was appropriate to engage in speaking objections, including objections that questions had been "asked and answered" previously during the deposition. Counsel argued that his "conduct was not 'malicious' not an attempt to interfere with the philosophy of CPLR 3113 and 3115."

**Key Issue:** Whether counsel's speaking objections and directions not to answer were proper under the deposition rules.

**Significance:** Demonstrates ongoing disputes over the scope of permissible objections and directions not to answer during depositions.

---

#### 11. Maraj v. Polevich
**2024 NY Slip Op 50705(U)**

The defendant moved for an order pursuant to CPLR 3108 and 3113 to initiate a commission to the appropriate authority in California so that a non-party could be legally required to provide testimony before a person authorized to take acknowledgments outside of New York.

**Key Issue:** The procedure for compelling testimony from a non-party witness located in another state.

**Significance:** Demonstrates the use of out-of-state commissions under CPLR 3108 and the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (CPLR 3119) for obtaining non-party testimony.

---

#### 12. A.S. v. A.B.
**2024 NY Slip Op 24191**

In a divorce case, the plaintiff served a subpoena on a non-party. The defendant filed a motion to quash the subpoena.

**Procedural Issue:** Defendant's counsel did not submit an affirmation that she conferred with opposing counsel in good faith to resolve the motion to quash.

**Holding:** Contrary to plaintiff's contentions, under the facts and circumstances presented, the failure to submit an attorney's affirmation attesting to a good-faith pre-motion attempt to resolve the dispute was not "fatally defective."

**Significance:** While good faith conferral is generally required before discovery motions, the absence of such attestation is not always fatal depending on the circumstances.

---

## V. FEDERAL COURTS IN NEW YORK (2024)

#### 13. MSG/James Dolan Apex Deposition Case
**S.D.N.Y. | 2024**

Madison Square Garden sought to prevent the deposition of its CEO, James Dolan, under the apex doctrine.

**Holding:** The motion to quash was denied; the CEO was compelled to sit for deposition.

**Key Ruling:** The court found that Dolan "had a courtside seat to the action here" and concluded that "The MSG defendants have failed to convincingly show that his deposition will result in harassment or potential disruption of the business of MSG."

**Significance:** The apex doctrine is facing increased judicial skepticism. High-level executives with personal knowledge of relevant facts will be compelled to testify despite arguments about business disruption.

---

**New York State Position:**
- No clear adoption of apex doctrine under New York state law
- High-level executives are "not immune per se" from depositions
- Executive must show they have "no unique, relevant information"

## VIII. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Attendance Is Mandatory:** Repeated failure to appear for court-ordered depositions will result in case-dispositive sanctions, including dismissal (O'Rourke v. Hammerstein Ballroom).

2. **Remote Depositions Require Good Cause:** Absent consent, the proponent of a remote deposition bears a substantial burden to establish good cause, particularly for important witnesses (DOIT Hospitality; Sumec Textile).

3. **Seven-Hour Limit Enforced:** Extensions of the seven-hour deposition limit require a showing of good cause, including evidence of obstruction or other circumstances (Wanliss v. Retina Assoc.).

4. **Speaking Objections Prohibited:** Objections must be stated succinctly without suggesting answers; speaking objections violate 22 NYCRR § 221.1 (Slapo v. Winthrop).

5. **Refusals to Answer Are Limited:** Witnesses may only refuse to answer to preserve privilege, enforce court limitations, or when a question is plainly improper and prejudicial.

6. **Deposition Misconduct Has Consequences:** Attorney misconduct during depositions may result in professional discipline, CLE requirements, and sanctions (Matter of Wolman; Matter of Renna).

7. **Non-Party Subpoenas Require 20 Days Notice:** Non-parties must be served at least 20 days before examination; burden shifts to non-party to show irrelevance (*Kapon* rule).

8. **Apex Doctrine Under Scrutiny:** High-level executives with personal knowledge of relevant facts will be compelled to testify despite arguments about business disruption (MSG/Dolan Case).

9. **Conferral Before Motion Practice:** Discovery disputes, including deposition disputes, should be addressed through conference before resort to motion practice (Commercial Division Rule 14).

10. **Good Faith Efforts Required:** Parties should attempt to resolve deposition disputes through good faith conferral before seeking court intervention.
