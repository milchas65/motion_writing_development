| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2024 WL 263121 |

| **Deficiency** | Log identified "communications between departments" without specifying whether recipients/creators were attorneys |

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 237 F.R.D. 69 |

## C. Statutory & Rule Framework

### CPLR § 3122(b) — Privilege Log Requirements

A litigant withholding documents must provide a log with:
- Type of document
- Date of document
- General subject matter
- Legal grounds for withholding
- Identifying information (author, recipients)

### Commercial Division Rule 11-b (eff. Sept. 2, 2014)

**Encourages categorical privilege logs** where appropriate:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Meet and Confer** | Parties must discuss privilege review scope at outset |
| **Categorical Logs** | Preferred over document-by-document when appropriate |
| **Certification** | Must explain why category is privileged and how review was conducted |
| **Consequence** | Inadequate categorical justification = all documents in category may be produced |

### Uniform Civil Rules § 202.20-a — Privilege Logs

- Applies to Supreme Court and County Court
- **Amended October 1, 2024** (effective December 2, 2024)

### Uniform Civil Rules § 202.20-f — Disclosure Disputes

Addresses procedures for resolving privilege log disputes

## D. What Makes a Privilege Log Adequate?

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Author** | Identity and capacity |
| **Recipients** | All individuals who received document |
| **Date** | Date of document/communication |
| **Subject Matter** | Brief description sufficient to determine if privilege applies |
| **Privilege Claimed** | Specific privilege or protection asserted |
| **Non-conclusory** | Cannot be mere boilerplate assertions |

### Common Deficiencies Leading to Waiver/Sanctions:

1. Failing to list withheld documents at all
2. Vague/conclusory descriptions
3. Not identifying whether authors/recipients were attorneys
4. Grouping many documents into too few log entries (e.g., 98 documents in 4 entries)
5. Blanket claims without specifics
