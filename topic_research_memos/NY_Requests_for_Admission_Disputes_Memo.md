**RE:**      Recent New York State Court Decisions on Requests for Admission Disputes

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum summarizes recent decisions from New York State courts addressing disputes involving requests for admission (also known as "notices to admit") under CPLR 3123. The cases cover issues including the proper scope of requests, improper use as a disclosure device, protective orders, deemed admissions, and penalties for unreasonable denials.

## II. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. First Department

#### 1. Sanquintin v. Cogliture
**2024 NY Slip Op 01883 | First Department | April 4, 2024**

In this automobile accident case, the defendant served a notice to admit approximately six months after the note of issue was filed. The notice requested plaintiff to admit or deny whether appended photos were a "fair and/or correct representation" of screenshots from various social media accounts, with highlighted dates indicating when the screenshots were taken.

**Procedural History:** The Supreme Court, New York County (James G. Clynes, J.), denied plaintiff's motion for a protective order pursuant to CPLR 3103 striking defendant's notice to admit.

**Holding:** The First Department unanimously reversed.

**Key Rulings:**
- The notice to admit did not ask plaintiff to admit or deny whether the photos were taken after his accident on April 24, 2019
- "To the extent the notice to admit seeks to validate and authenticate photographs that may have been taken before plaintiff's accident, the notice to admit is improperly being used as a disclosure device"
- Plaintiff was entitled to a protective order

**Legal Standard Articulated:**
"Notices to admit are properly stricken when they are used as an improper disclosure device, expand and raise new factual issues that should have been resolved during discovery, or impermissibly compel admission of fundamental and material issues or ultimate facts that can only be resolved after a full trial."

**Significance:** This decision clarifies that notices to admit seeking authentication of photographs must be narrowly tailored to the relevant time period and cannot be used to obtain information that should have been sought through other discovery devices.

## III. COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 2. Novum Energy Trading Inc. v. Transmontaigne Operating Co. L.P.
**Index No. 655283/2023 | Justice Margaret A. Chan | August 27, 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 33524(U)**

In this commercial dispute regarding a storage agreement, the defendant served eight Requests for Admission on the plaintiff.

**Holding:** The court found seven of the eight Requests for Admission to be improper and struck them.

**Analysis of Each Request:**

| Request | Subject Matter | Ruling |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Disputed facts | Stricken |
| 2 | Ultimate issues | Stricken |
| 3 | "The Second Amendment does not list a Service Term" | **Proper** |
| 4-7 | Disputed facts/ultimate issues | Stricken |
| 8 | Seeking information through admission | Stricken |

**Key Rulings:**

**Request 8:** Sought an admission that "Novum relied on TransMontaigne, which is the only party with knowledge as to its calculations regarding the termination dates." The court found this was "an attempt to get information available through other disclosure devices" and therefore "not a proper use of the request to admit."

**Request 3:** This was the only proper request. The court explained: "While the Service Term itself is at the heart of the issues in this case, it is precisely because the Second Amendment does not 'list' a Service Term that there is an issue to begin with." Asking whether a document contains a particular term is a proper use of the notice to admit.

**Significance:** This decision provides a detailed roadmap for distinguishing between proper requests (document contents, uncontested facts) and improper requests (disputed facts, ultimate issues, information-gathering).

## IV. OTHER TRIAL COURT DECISIONS

#### 3. L.I. v. Holy Name Province of the Order of the Friars Minor
**Justice Hasa A. Kingo | December 18, 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 51727(U)**

In this action, Co-Defendant Holy Name Province opposed BBBSA's motion for sanctions and cross-moved for sanctions against BBBSA.

**Holy Name's Arguments:**
- BBBSA's Notice to Admit "improperly sought admissions outside Holy Name's knowledge"
- "BBBSA's litigation tactics amount to harassment and have unnecessarily increased the cost and burden of litigation"

**Significance:** This case demonstrates that parties may seek sanctions against opponents who serve notices to admit that seek admissions on matters outside the responding party's knowledge or that constitute litigation harassment.

---

#### 4. Perella Weinberg Partners LLC v. Kramer LLC
**2025**

The defendant served a notice to admit on April 2, 2024.

**Holding:** The court found the notice to admit proper.

**Key Rulings:**
- The notice to admit did not fall into any of the categories for preclusion
- The notice was not served as a discovery device or used to obtain information in lieu of other devices
- The notice did not raise new issues unresolved in discovery
- The notice did not compel admissions of ultimate facts unresolvable without trial
- "The notice to admit was served in an effort to clarify or eliminate factual disputes at trial"

**Significance:** This decision provides a positive example of a properly crafted notice to admit that fulfills its intended purpose of streamlining trial by eliminating uncontested issues.

## V. CPLR 3123 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

### A. Authorization and Timing

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Earliest Service** | After service of answer OR 20 days from service of summons (whichever is sooner) |
| **Latest Service** | Not later than 20 days before trial |
| **Response Deadline** | 20 days after service (unless court extends) |

### B. Permissible Scope

Under CPLR 3123(a), a party may request admission of:
1. **Genuineness of papers or documents**
2. **Correctness or fairness of representation of photographs**
3. **Truth of matters of fact** as to which the requesting party "reasonably believes there can be no substantial dispute at the trial"

The matters must be "within the knowledge of such other party or can be ascertained by him upon reasonable inquiry."

### C. Form of Response

The party to whom the request is directed must serve a **sworn statement** either:
1. Denying specifically the matters of which an admission is requested, OR
2. Setting forth in detail the reasons why they cannot truthfully either admit or deny those matters

### D. Deemed Admitted Rule

"Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted unless within twenty days after service thereof or within such further time as the court may allow, the party to whom the request is directed serves" a proper response.

**Important Caveat:** Silence is only deemed an admission if the request was proper under CPLR 3123. Courts may excuse failure to respond if the notice was improper (*Marguess v. City of New York*).

### E. Effect of Admission

- Admission is for the purpose of the pending action only
- Does not constitute an admission for any other purpose
- May not be used against the party in any other proceeding
- Court may allow amendment or withdrawal "on such terms as may be just"

### F. Penalty for Unreasonable Denial (CPLR 3123(c))

If a party:
1. Does not admit a matter, AND
2. The requesting party thereafter proves the matter at trial

The requesting party may move "at or immediately following the trial" for an order requiring the denying party to pay:
- Reasonable expenses incurred in making such proof
- Including reasonable attorney's fees

**Mandatory Award:** "Unless the court finds that there were good reasons for the denial or the refusal otherwise to admit or that the admissions sought were of no substantial importance, the order shall be made irrespective of the result of the action."

## VI. PROPER VS. IMPROPER REQUESTS

### A. Proper Requests

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Document Authenticity** | Genuineness of contracts, agreements, correspondence |
| **Photograph Accuracy** | Correctness of representation of photographs (if properly tailored) |
| **Document Contents** | Whether a document contains or lacks specific terms (*Novum Energy*) |
| **Undisputed Facts** | Matters where there can be no substantial dispute |
| **Easily Provable Facts** | Facts that are readily admittable |

### B. Improper Requests

| Category | Authority |
|----------|-----------|
| **Disputed Facts** | *Novum Energy v. Transmontaigne* |
| **Ultimate Issues/Liability** | *Sanquintin v. Cogliture* |
| **Information-Gathering** | *Novum Energy* (Request 8) |
| **Matters Outside Knowledge** | *L.I. v. Holy Name Province* |
| **Legal Conclusions** | Practice Commentaries |
| **New Factual Issues** | *Sanquintin v. Cogliture* |
| **Highly Technical/Scientific Information** | Case law (expert witness matters) |
| **Fundamental/Material Issues** | *Sanquintin v. Cogliture* |

### C. The "Proper Purpose" Test

The only proper purpose of a notice to admit is "to eliminate from contention those matters which are not in dispute in the litigation and which may be readily disposed of." (*32nd Ave. LLC v. Angelo Holding Corp.*, 20 N.Y.S.3d 420, 422 [N.Y. App. Div. 2015]).

---

## VII. PROTECTIVE ORDERS (CPLR 3103)

### A. When Available

A protective order may be sought when a notice to admit:
- Seeks admissions on contested facts
- Requests legal conclusions
- Seeks highly technical, detailed, or scientific information that is the subject for examination by an expert witness
- Is used in lieu of other disclosure devices
- Goes to material issues in dispute
- Seeks matters outside the responding party's knowledge

### B. Procedure

**Best Practice:** Move for a protective order rather than ignoring an improper notice.

**Rationale:** Although the court may ultimately find the notice so unreasonable that the ignoring party will face no sanction, ignoring a notice to admit is perilous because "silence is deemed an admission" (CPLR 3123[a]).

As Professor Patrick Connors states in the Practice Commentaries to CPLR 3123, "the wisest course" is to move for a protective order pursuant to CPLR 3103.

### C. Available Relief

The court may:
- Strike the notice to admit in whole or in part
- Vacate the notice
- Order that failure to respond shall not be deemed an admission
- Impose conditions on the requesting party

---

## VIII. COMMERCIAL DIVISION CONSIDERATIONS

### A. Accelerated Track Cases

Under Commercial Division Rule 9(c)(5), cases proceeding on the accelerated track have limited discovery:
- **Maximum 5 requests for admission**
- Compared to unlimited requests in standard track cases

### B. Good Faith Responses

The Commercial Division "has little patience for pro forma denials and may treat them as if no response were made."

### C. Cost Recovery

If a denial is unreasonable, parties can recover the costs of proving the facts denied, including attorneys' fees (CPLR 3123[c]).

## IX. TYPES OF REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION DISPUTES

| Issue | Key Cases | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Improper Disclosure Device** | Sanquintin v. Cogliture | Protective order granted |
| **Disputed Facts/Ultimate Issues** | Novum Energy v. Transmontaigne | 7 of 8 requests stricken |
| **Matters Outside Knowledge** | L.I. v. Holy Name Province | Cross-motion for sanctions |
| **Proper Clarification of Issues** | Perella Weinberg v. Kramer | Notice upheld |
| **Document Contents** | Novum Energy (Request 3) | Request proper |

---

## X. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Limited Purpose:** Notices to admit may only be used to eliminate uncontested issues; they cannot be used as a discovery device to obtain information (*Sanquintin v. Cogliture*; *Novum Energy*).

2. **Disputed Facts Are Off-Limits:** Requests seeking admission of disputed facts or ultimate issues will be stricken (*Novum Energy v. Transmontaigne*).

3. **Document Contents Are Proper:** Asking whether a document contains or lacks specific terms is a proper use of the notice to admit (*Novum Energy* - Request 3).

4. **Tailoring Required for Photographs:** Requests to authenticate photographs must be narrowly tailored to the relevant time period (*Sanquintin v. Cogliture*).

5. **Move for Protective Order:** Rather than ignoring an improper notice, move for a protective order under CPLR 3103; silence is deemed admission if the request was proper.

6. **Deemed Admitted Rule Has Limits:** Courts may excuse failure to respond if the notice was improper in scope (*Marguess v. City of New York*).

7. **Penalty for Unreasonable Denial:** If a party denies a matter that is later proved, the court shall order payment of expenses including attorney's fees unless good reasons existed for the denial (CPLR 3123[c]).

8. **Accelerated Track Limits:** In Commercial Division accelerated track cases, parties are limited to 5 requests for admission.

9. **Admissions Are Case-Specific:** Any admission is for the pending action only and cannot be used in other proceedings.

10. **Court May Allow Withdrawal:** The court may permit amendment or withdrawal of admissions "on such terms as may be just."
