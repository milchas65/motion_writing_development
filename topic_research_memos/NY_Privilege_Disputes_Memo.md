**RE:**      Recent New York State Court Decisions on Privilege Disputes in Discovery

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum summarizes recent decisions from New York State courts addressing privilege disputes in discovery. The cases cover attorney-client privilege, work product protection, privilege logs, waiver issues, the crime-fraud exception, common interest doctrine, and other privilege claims.

---

## II. NEW YORK COURT OF APPEALS DECISIONS

#### 1. Matter of Appellate Advocates v. NYS Department of Corrections & Community Supervision
**Court of Appeals | 2024**

The New York Court of Appeals addressed whether internal training materials prepared by agency counsel were protected by the attorney-client privilege.

**Holdings:**

1. **No Litigation Requirement:** The Court rejected the argument that the attorney-client privilege applies only to an existing factual dispute. The Court clarified that it had never endorsed the position that the privilege applies only to communications made in anticipation of litigation or during a pending action.

2. **Proactive Advice is Protected:** The Court rejected the argument that privilege applies only where a client directly requests counsel's advice. Counsel may, in its "professional judgment, experience, skill, and knowledge of the law," bring legal matters to the client's attention without the client initiating contact.

3. **Training Materials Can Be Privileged:** Internal training materials reflecting legal analysis of statutory, regulatory, and decisional law constituted privileged attorney-client communications "prepared for the purpose of facilitating the rendition of legal advice or services, in the course of a professional relationship."

4. **Format Does Not Matter:** The lawyer's communication of analysis and advice is privileged regardless of whether counsel communicates its view to the client in a slide show, as opposed to in a letter or memorandum.

**Significance:** This decision significantly expands the scope of attorney-client privilege in New York, confirming that proactive legal advice and training materials may be protected even absent pending litigation or a specific client request.

## III. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. Second Department

#### 2. Joseph v. Rassi
**Appellate Division, Second Department | September 25, 2024**

In this breach of fiduciary duty action, the plaintiff moved to compel the defendants to produce a document-by-document privilege log in conformity with CPLR 3122(b).

**Holding:** Motion to compel granted. The defendants' privilege log failed to individually identify each type of document being withheld, the general subject matter of each document, and the date of each document.

**Key Ruling:** Commercial Division Rule 11-b(b) does not authorize a party's unilateral use of categorical designations in a privilege log, absent an agreement by the parties to employ a categorical approach or the issuance of a protective order. Parties must produce document-by-document privilege logs under CPLR 3122(b) unless otherwise agreed or ordered.

**Significance:** This decision clarifies the tension between the Commercial Division's preference for categorical privilege logs (Rule 11-b) and CPLR 3122(b)'s requirements for specific identification of withheld documents.

---

### B. First Department

#### 3. Structure Tone Global Services, Inc.
**Appellate Division, First Department | 2024**

Following discovery sanctions that struck defendant's answer, the Appellate Division modified the order.

**Holding:** Answer reinstated, conditioned on defendant providing discovery along with a privilege log identifying any withheld documents within 30 days.

**Significance:** Demonstrates that privilege logs remain required even when other discovery disputes are being resolved, and that courts will impose deadlines for privilege log production.

---

## IV. NEW YORK COUNTY COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 4. Altium Growth Fund v. Tingo Group
**Justice Andrew Borrok | December 9, 2024**

A judgment debtor publicly denied fraud allegations in a press release, stating the denial was "based on and in reliance on advice received from outside counsel's investigation." At a subsequent deposition, the debtor's counsel (Greenberg Traurig, LLP) refused to answer certain questions based on attorney-client privilege.

**Holding:** The judgment debtor waived its ability to assert attorney-client privilege over the outside counsel investigation.

**Key Ruling:** Public statements referencing legal advice or relying on counsel's work product may result in waiver of the attorney-client privilege. A party cannot use privilege as both a sword and a shield.

---

#### 5. Bangladesh Bank v. Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation
**Index No. 652051/2024 | Justice Andrea Masley | December 21, 2024**

The plaintiff moved to compel a Filipino bank to collect and search documents from one of its in-house counsel.

**Holding:** Motion to compel granted despite the bank's claim that the information possessed by its lawyer would be privileged.

**Key Ruling:** Privilege objections must be specifically supported; blanket assertions of privilege for in-house counsel documents are insufficient to avoid production obligations.

---

#### 6. ARC NYWWPJV001, LLC v. WWP JV LLC
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | November 29, 2024**

The defendant inadvertently produced two allegedly privileged documents and sought to claw them back. The plaintiff moved to require defendant to produce these documents again.

**Holding:** Motion to compel production of purportedly privileged documents granted in part.

**Significance:** Addresses the interplay between inadvertent production, clawback procedures, and privilege claims in the Commercial Division.

---

#### 7. CWCapital Cobalt VR Ltd. v. CWCapital Investments LLC
**Justice Andrea Masley | January 20, 2024**

The parties disputed whether 35 emails were protected by the attorney-client privilege.

**Holding:** In camera review granted for 35 emails over which defendants claimed attorney-client privilege.

**Significance:** Demonstrates that in camera review has become common practice in the Commercial Division for resolving privilege disputes, particularly where the privilege log alone is insufficient to determine the validity of the claim.

---

#### 8. Simpson v. Chassen
**Commercial Division | 2025**

The plaintiff sought production of a joint defense agreement ("JDA") entered into by the defendants. Defendants claimed the JDA was protected under attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine.

**Holding:** Motion to compel production of the JDA granted.

**Key Rulings:**
- The JDA did not establish an attorney-client relationship or facilitate legal advice, and thus was not privileged
- The JDA lacked legal analysis or strategy, rendering it unprotected as attorney work product
- Joint defense agreements are not automatically privileged and may be subject to disclosure even if prepared by counsel

**Significance:** Reinforces that the common interest doctrine is limited to situations involving pending or reasonably anticipated litigation, and that JDAs must contain substantive legal content to qualify for protection.

---

## V. OTHER NEW YORK STATE COURT DECISIONS

#### 9. Molner
**New York State Court | 2024**

In a divorce proceeding, the husband sought communications between his wife (a physician) and her parents regarding privileged matters.

**Holding:** The physician waived her attorney-client privilege protection by discussing privileged communications with her parents.

**Key Ruling:** "An educated, practicing physician" could not reasonably expect that "all communications involving her parents would remain confidential." The expectation of confidentiality when sharing privileged information with family members is unreasonable.

---

#### 10. People v. Doe
**August 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 24301**

A health care provider sought guidance on disclosure of medical records to the District Attorney's Office.

**Holding:** The court agreed to review medical records in camera prior to sharing with the District Attorney's Office.

**Key Ruling:** Medical records are protected by the physician-patient privilege under CPLR § 4504(a). In camera review is appropriate to determine the scope of any required disclosure while protecting patient privacy.

---

#### 11. D.P. v. S.P.
**2024 NY Slip Op 24320**

In a custody dispute, one party sought the psychotherapy notes of the other parent.

**Holding:** Psychotherapy notes may be subject to disclosure, but with appropriate protections.

**Key Ruling:** "Appropriate efforts must be made by the court to protect the privacy of the patient/parent by determining the appropriate time period of such disclosure, entering a protective order prohibiting the disclosure of the notes beyond the subject litigation, and through in camera inspection of the notes by the court."

---

#### 12. People v. Trump
**April 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 50465(U)**

The defendant subpoenaed a journalist for testimony and documents.

**Holdings:**
- New York's Shield Law provides journalists an absolute privilege from testifying regarding news obtained under a promise of confidentiality
- A qualified privilege applies to news that is both unpublished and not obtained under a promise of confidentiality

**Key Ruling:** The subpoena was quashed as "far too broad and seeks general discovery." Subpoenas to journalists must be "highly specific and narrowly tailored."

---

#### 13. J.F. v. 110 Grill
**February 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 24038**

In a civil action, the defendant sought to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination to preclude all discovery.

**Holding:** Paper discovery and depositions must proceed.

**Key Ruling:** "Invoking the privilege against self-incrimination is generally an insufficient basis for precluding discovery in a civil matter." The defendant may invoke the right against self-incrimination when answering specific interrogatories or deposition questions, but cannot use it to block all discovery.

---

## VI. FEDERAL COURT DECISIONS (NEW YORK DISTRICTS)

#### 14. La Liberte v. Reid
**E.D.N.Y. | January 2, 2024**

In a defamation action against MSNBC host Joy Reid, the plaintiff alleged that NBCU lawyers engaged in a scheme to delete social media analytics. The defendants asserted attorney-client privilege and work product protection.

**Holding:** After in camera review, the court found "no factual support for the allegation that NBCU lawyers engaged in a scheme to delete and destroy social media analytics associated with the subject posts."

**Significance:** Demonstrates the application of in camera review to evaluate crime-fraud exception claims, with the court ultimately upholding the privilege claims.

---

#### 15. Coker v. Goldberg & Associates P.C.
**S.D.N.Y. | January 24, 2024 | 2024 WL 263121**

The defendant failed to produce a privilege log for documents withheld from discovery.

**Holding:** Failure to produce a privilege log resulted in waiver of privilege and warranted sanctions under Rule 37(b)(2).

**Key Rulings:**
- A judge need not specify every item a party must produce before sanctions can be awarded; it was sufficient for the court to order that "all discovery" must be produced by a date certain
- Privilege logs are not optional; production of a privilege log is a critical last step for document production
- The court invoked its Rule 37 authority sua sponte, even though the plaintiff didn't raise Rule 37 as a basis for sanctions

---

#### 16. Spencer-Smith v. Ehrlich
**S.D.N.Y. | October 4, 2024 | 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 182115**

The plaintiff disclosed privileged communications and work product to her mother and long-time partner.

**Holdings:**
- Disclosure of privileged communications to family members (even a "best friend") waives attorney-client privilege
- Disclosure of work product to the same individuals did NOT waive work product protection

**Key Ruling:** "There is no privilege protecting correspondence with a confidante simply because the person is a confidante." However, work product protection is more robust and survives disclosure to family members where there is no indication the disclosure would reach an adversary.

**Significance:** Highlights the critical difference between the "fragile" attorney-client privilege and the more "robust" work product doctrine when it comes to waiver through disclosure to third parties.

---

#### 17. Crime-Fraud Exception Case
**S.D.N.Y. | June 2024 (affirmed by Second Circuit February 2025)**

The government moved to compel production of communications between a public company CEO and his outside lawyer, arguing the crime-fraud exception applied.

**Holding:** Motion to compel granted in part after in camera review. The court "found probable cause that communications included in the documents were made in furtherance of a crime or fraud."

**Key Findings:**
- The outside lawyer and CEO circumvented the company's internal controls by concealing claims and settlement agreements
- False and misleading statements were made to auditors by failing to mention claims as contingencies in the audit response letter

**Legal Standard:** The crime-fraud exception requires "a factual basis for a showing of probable cause to believe that a fraud or crime has been committed and that the communications in question were in furtherance of the fraud or crime."

---

## VII. PRIVILEGE LOG REQUIREMENTS

### A. CPLR 3122(b) Requirements

Under CPLR 3122(b), a privilege log must individually identify:
- Each type of document being withheld
- The general subject matter of each document
- The date of each document

### B. Commercial Division Rule 11-b

Commercial Division Rule 11-b(b) expresses a preference for categorical privilege logs, including cost-shifting provisions if one party insists on an item-by-item log. However, per *Joseph v. Rassi*, parties cannot unilaterally adopt categorical logs without:
- Agreement of the parties, or
- A court order or protective order

### C. Consequences of Non-Compliance

Failure to produce a proper privilege log may result in:
- Waiver of privilege (*Coker v. Goldberg*)
- Sanctions under CPLR 3126 or Rule 37
- Compelled production of withheld documents

## IX. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Privilege Logs Must Be Specific:** Document-by-document privilege logs are required under CPLR 3122(b) unless the parties agree to categorical logs or a court order permits them (Joseph v. Rassi).

2. **Failure to Log = Waiver:** Failure to produce a privilege log may result in complete waiver of privilege and sanctions (Coker v. Goldberg).

3. **Public Statements Can Waive Privilege:** Publicly referencing or relying on legal advice may waive the attorney-client privilege (Altium Growth Fund v. Tingo).

4. **Family Disclosures Waive Privilege, Not Work Product:** Sharing privileged communications with family members waives attorney-client privilege, but the same disclosure does not waive work product protection (Spencer-Smith v. Ehrlich; Molner).

5. **Training Materials May Be Privileged:** Internal training materials containing legal analysis can be privileged even without pending litigation or a specific client request (Appellate Advocates v. DOCCS).

6. **JDAs Are Not Automatically Privileged:** Joint defense agreements must contain substantive legal content to be protected; they are not privileged merely because attorneys prepared them (Simpson v. Chassen).

7. **In Camera Review Is Common:** Courts regularly conduct in camera review to resolve privilege disputes, particularly for crime-fraud exception claims (CWCapital; La Liberte v. Reid).

8. **Crime-Fraud Exception Requires Probable Cause:** The exception applies where there is probable cause to believe communications were made in furtherance of a crime or fraud (S.D.N.Y. June 2024 Case).

9. **Self-Incrimination Does Not Block Civil Discovery:** Parties may invoke Fifth Amendment rights question-by-question but cannot use the privilege to preclude all discovery (J.F. v. 110 Grill).

10. **Journalist Privilege Has Limits:** While absolute for confidential sources, the Shield Law provides only qualified protection for unpublished, non-confidential material (People v. Trump).
