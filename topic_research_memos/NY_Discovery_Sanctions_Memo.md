**RE:**      Recent New York State Court Decisions on Discovery Sanctions

This memorandum summarizes recent decisions from New York State courts imposing discovery sanctions under CPLR 3126 and related authority. The cases address various forms of sanctions including striking pleadings, dismissal, monetary penalties, evidence preclusion, and spoliation remedies.

---

## II. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. Fourth Department

#### 1. Buffalo Biodiesel, Inc. v. Blue Bridge Fin., LLC
**Appellate Division, Fourth Department | June 14, 2024 | 2024 N.Y. Slip Op. 03259**

In this action for libel and tortious interference, the plaintiff admitted it had failed to issue a litigation hold and failed to suspend the routine deletion of its emails during the litigation. When plaintiff attempted to subpoena the deleted emails, the financial services company hosting the server was no longer operating and the emails could not be recovered.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court properly struck the complaint and dismissed plaintiff's remaining causes of action with prejudice. The Fourth Department affirmed.

**Key Ruling:** Plaintiff's failure to "suspend the routine deletion of its emails during the course of litigation" and deletion of the emails "constituted the grossly negligent spoliation of evidence." The court rejected plaintiff's contention that the sanction was an abuse of discretion.

---

#### 2. Storm v. Kaleida Health
**Appellate Division, Fourth Department | 2024**

This case addressed spoliation sanctions where evidence was destroyed through negligence.

**Key Ruling:** Spoliation sanctions may be appropriate even if the destruction occurred through negligence rather than willfulness. Sanctions may be imposed upon a party even though that party did not own or control the evidence, so long as the party had an opportunity to safeguard it.

---

### B. Second Department

#### 3. Muhammad v. Ramadan
**Appellate Division, Second Department | June 5, 2024**

The plaintiffs moved pursuant to CPLR 3126 to strike defendants' answer for failure to comply with court orders and discovery demands over an extended period.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in granting the plaintiffs' motion to strike the defendants' answer.

**Key Ruling:** "Willful and contumacious conduct may be inferred from a party's repeated failure to comply with court-ordered discovery, coupled with inadequate explanations for the failures to comply, or a failure to comply with court-ordered discovery over an extended period of time."

---

#### 4. Matter of Dahan
**Appellate Division, Second Department | 2024**

In this Surrogate's Court proceeding, the respondent repeatedly failed to comply with discovery demands despite a court order directing her to do so.

**Holding:** The Surrogate's Court "providently exercised its discretion in imposing a sanction against Nelson pursuant to CPLR 3126 by directing her to pay the administrators the sum of $1,890 for attorneys' fees."

**Significance:** Demonstrates that monetary sanctions are appropriate even in Surrogate's Court proceedings for discovery violations.

---

#### 5. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Louis
**Appellate Division, Second Department | 2024**

The defendant moved pursuant to CPLR 3126 to impose discovery sanctions against the plaintiff or, alternatively, pursuant to CPLR 3124 to compel compliance with discovery demands.

**Key Ruling:** "The striking of a party's pleading under CPLR 3126(3) as a penalty for the willful nondisclosure of discovery, which is tantamount to the dismissal of a claim or defense, emanates from a motion made on notice."

---

#### 6. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Evanson
**Appellate Division, Second Department | September 11, 2024**

In a mortgage foreclosure action, the defendant moved to strike the plaintiff's complaint under CPLR 3126(3) after plaintiff failed to respond to discovery demands.

**Holding:** Motion to strike denied.

**Key Ruling:** Absent "exigent circumstances," prior to seeking court involvement to resolve a discovery dispute, counsel must confer and make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute pursuant to 22 NYCRR 202.7 and 202.20-f. The defendant failed to comply with these procedural prerequisites.

---

### C. First Department

#### 7. Lis v. Lancaster
**Appellate Division, First Department | March 28, 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op. 01763**

The motion court considered a CPLR 3126 motion to strike based on alleged willfully withheld discovery and lack of candor in connection with the nondisclosure of certain documents.

**Holding:** The First Department affirmed the trial court's sua sponte award of monetary sanctions.

**Key Ruling:** A court may assess monetary discovery sanctions under 22 NYCRR § 130-1.1 even if a motion for sanctions does not specifically seek them. The court found that some documents should have been produced and this amounted to frivolous discovery conduct. The failure to include documents on a privilege log and the absence of a clawback provision underscored defendants' willful noncompliance.

---

#### 8. Ferrer v. Go New York Tours Inc.
**Appellate Division, First Department | 2024**

Following an accident involving a tour company bus, the defendant's employees reviewed video footage from the six cameras on the bus, forwarded two videos to its insurer, and deleted the rest.

**Holding:** Spoliation sanctions imposed.

**Key Ruling:** For spoliation sanctions, a "culpable state of mind" includes ordinary negligence—a much lower bar than deliberate misconduct. The plaintiff must show: (1) the party having control over the evidence possessed an obligation to preserve it at the time of destruction; (2) the evidence was destroyed "with a culpable state of mind"; and (3) the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party's claim or defense.

---

#### 9. Taxi Tours Inc. v. Go N.Y. Tours Inc.
**Appellate Division, First Department | 2024 | 227 A.D.3d 530**

The defendant failed to comply with Commercial Division Rule 13(c)(B), which requires disclosure of "the data forming the basis for its expert's opinion."

**Holding:** The trial court's exclusion of expert testimony was affirmed, and leave to reopen discovery was denied.

**Key Ruling:** Defendant "should have known about its Rule 13(c) obligation to supply that data while submitting the expert disclosure." Practitioners should be familiar with these requirements to avoid the cost and embarrassment of attempting to justify noncompliance after the fact.

---

## III. NEW YORK COUNTY COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 10. O'Rourke v. Hammerstein Ballroom
**Justice Margaret A. Chan | August 22, 2024**

Between November 2021 and January 2024, the court held eight discovery conferences with the parties and scheduled plaintiff's deposition each time. The plaintiff failed to appear for each of his eight separate court-ordered depositions.

**Holding:** Complaint dismissed as a sanction under CPLR 3126.

**Key Ruling:** "The sanction befitting the lackadaisical handling of this case is dismissal of plaintiff's complaint." The Commercial Division will enforce a "strict, no-tolerance approach in disposing of cases for willful discovery violations."

---

#### 11. Five Star Electric Corp. v. The Trustees of Columbia University
**Index No. 655947/2018 | Justice Joel M. Cohen | September 30, 2024**

The plaintiff committed discovery violations warranting sanctions.

**Holding:** The court granted defendants' motion to strike plaintiff's complaint pursuant to CPLR § 3126 for discovery violations.

---

#### 12. Earthlink, LLC v. Charter Communications Operating, LLC
**Justice Andrea Masley | January 18, 2024**

The defendant failed to preserve recordings of customer calls despite pending litigation.

**Holding:** Sanctions granted for spoliation of evidence.

**Key Ruling:** The court rejected Charter's claim that preserving recordings of millions of calls over several months was impossible. Parties must implement adequate litigation holds upon notice of potential litigation.

---

#### 13. EXRP 14 Holdings LLC v. LS-15 Ave LLC
**Justice Melissa A. Crane | September 5, 2024**

Following the court's prior grant of plaintiff's motion for sanctions, plaintiff sought attorneys' fees.

**Holding:** The court declined to award plaintiff the full amount of requested attorneys' fees and reduced the requested amount by 50%.

**Significance:** Courts have discretion to reduce fee awards even after finding sanctions appropriate.

---

#### 14. SG575 Holdings LLC v. Richard Stuyvesant Holdings
**Justice Margaret A. Chan | January 2024**

The defendants repeatedly failed to comply with court orders, missing discovery deadlines three times and failing to produce any ESI, offering no excuse. The court had previously sanctioned defendants for these violations.

**Holding:** The court both granted defendants' motion to dismiss on other grounds AND granted plaintiff's request for sanctions for discovery violations.

**Key Ruling:** "A monetary sanction of an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs is appropriate under CPLR 3126 to compensate counsel for time expended related to a failure to provide discovery." Discovery sanctions may be imposed even when other relief is granted to the sanctioned party.

---

#### 15. Tsung Tsin Association, Inc. v. Tian Xiang Zhu
**Justice Jennifer G. Schecter | 2024**

The defendant and his counsel "ignored and violated virtually every one of the court's discovery directives."

**Holding:** The court struck the defendant's answer and granted permission to file a motion for default judgment.

**Key Ruling:** The court had "no confidence that a lesser sanction will impel compliance" based on the "willful and contumacious" conduct demonstrated.

---

## IV. OTHER TRIAL COURT DECISIONS

#### 16. Kastel Renaissance Interiors, Inc. v. Cholera
**2024 NY Slip Op 50434(U) | April 2, 2024**

The plaintiff delayed providing requested discovery despite multiple unsuccessful attempts by defendants to obtain discovery short of motion practice.

**Holding:** Motion for CPLR 3126 discovery sanctions granted in part. Plaintiff ordered to pay defendants' reasonable attorney fees incurred in making the motion.

**Key Ruling:** Monetary sanctions appropriate given "the length of plaintiff's delay in providing the requested discovery, and the number of (unsuccessful) attempts that defendants made to obtain that discovery short of motion practice."

---

#### 17. Tantaros v. Krechmer
**2024 NY Slip Op 50351(U)**

The plaintiff "repeatedly ignored this Court's order and failed to show a good-faith effort to address defendant's discovery demands," failing to comply with three court orders.

**Holding:** Complaint dismissed.

**Key Ruling:** Since plaintiff's "failure to comply with three court orders was willful and contumacious and she has not advanced a reasonable justification, sanctions are warranted."

---

#### 18. Burke v. City of New York
**December 27, 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 51787(U)**

The defendant sought sanctions pursuant to CPLR § 3126 for the City's allegedly willful, unexcused, and contumacious failure to comply with a court order.

**Holding:** Motion for sanctions pursuant to CPLR § 3126 denied.

**Significance:** Not all discovery disputes warrant sanctions; the court retains discretion to deny sanctions where appropriate.

---

#### 19. Abuzaid v. Almoayouf
**2024**

The first discovery request was served in 2020, but the plaintiff did not receive relief until 2024 due to defendant's sustained defiance.

**Holding:** Sanctions imposed under CPLR 3126 for sustained discovery defiance.

**Key Ruling:** CPLR 3126 authorizes sanctions against a party who "refuses to obey an order for disclosure or willfully fails to disclose information which the court finds ought to have been disclosed."

## VI. LEGAL STANDARDS

### A. Willful and Contumacious Conduct

"Willful and contumacious" conduct may be inferred from:
- Repeated failure to comply with court-ordered discovery
- Inadequate explanations for failures to comply
- Failure to comply over an extended period of time
- Ignoring multiple court orders

### B. Spoliation Standard

A party seeking spoliation sanctions must show:
1. The party having control over the evidence possessed an obligation to preserve it at the time of destruction
2. The evidence was destroyed with a "culpable state of mind" (includes ordinary negligence)
3. The destroyed evidence was relevant to the party's claim or defense

### C. Procedural Prerequisites

Before seeking sanctions:
- Counsel must confer in good faith to resolve the dispute (22 NYCRR 202.7, 202.20-f)
- Motion must be accompanied by affirmation of good faith efforts
- Generally should move to compel (CPLR 3124) before seeking sanctions (CPLR 3126)

### D. Court's Discretion

- The nature and degree of sanction is within the broad discretion of the motion court
- Striking pleadings is an "extreme measure" reserved for willful/contumacious conduct
- Courts may impose lesser sanctions than requested
- Courts may impose sanctions sua sponte under 22 NYCRR § 130-1.1

---

## VII. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Litigation Holds Are Critical:** Failure to issue a litigation hold and suspend routine document deletion constitutes grossly negligent spoliation (Buffalo Biodiesel).

2. **Ordinary Negligence Suffices for Spoliation:** A "culpable state of mind" for spoliation includes ordinary negligence, not just intentional destruction (Ferrer v. Go NY Tours).

3. **Repeated Non-Compliance Has Consequences:** Repeated failure to comply with discovery orders over time supports inference of willful conduct warranting severe sanctions (Muhammad v. Ramadan; Tantaros).

4. **Deposition Attendance Is Mandatory:** Repeated failure to appear for depositions will result in dismissal (O'Rourke v. Hammerstein Ballroom).

5. **Confer Before Filing:** Failure to confer in good faith before seeking sanctions will result in denial of the motion (Bayview Loan Servicing).

6. **Monetary Sanctions Available Sua Sponte:** Courts may impose monetary sanctions under 22 NYCRR § 130-1.1 even when not specifically requested (Lis v. Lancaster).

7. **Expert Disclosure Rules Enforced:** Failure to provide data underlying expert opinions will result in preclusion (Taxi Tours v. Go NY Tours).

8. **Sanctions Can Accompany Other Relief:** Discovery sanctions may be imposed even when the court grants other relief to the sanctioned party (SG575 Holdings).

9. **Lesser Sanctions Preferred:** Courts prefer to impose sanctions short of dismissal where possible, but will dismiss for egregious conduct (Storm v. Kaleida; Tsung Tsin).

10. **Fee Awards May Be Reduced:** Courts have discretion to reduce attorneys' fee awards even after finding sanctions appropriate (EXRP 14 Holdings).
