## Legal Standard

### The "Utterly Refutes" Test

Under CPLR 3211(a)(1), a motion to dismiss based on documentary evidence may be granted only where:

> "The documentary evidence **utterly refutes** plaintiff's factual allegations, **conclusively establishing** a defense as a matter of law."
> — *Goshen v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N.Y.*, 98 NY2d 314, 326 (2002)

### Requirements for Documentary Evidence

To qualify as "documentary evidence" under CPLR 3211(a)(1), the evidence must be:

1. **Unambiguous** - Clear on its face
2. **Authentic** - Of undisputed origin
3. **Undeniable** - Contents cannot be controverted

*See Granada Condominium III Assn. v. Palomino, 78 AD3d 996 (2d Dept. 2010); Fontanetta v. John Doe 1, 73 AD3d 78 (2d Dept. 2010)*

### What Qualifies as Documentary Evidence

Courts have held that the following qualify:
- Judicial records (judgments, orders, transcripts)
- Documents reflecting out-of-court transactions:
  - Mortgages
  - Deeds
  - Contracts
  - Wills
  - Corporate charter/incorporation records
- Other papers whose contents are "essentially undeniable"

### What Does NOT Qualify

Courts consistently hold that the following do NOT qualify:
- Affidavits
- Deposition testimony
- Letters
- Emails (in Second Department)
- Verified complaints
- Attorney affirmations

## Evidence Analysis: What Works vs. What Doesn't

### Evidence That WORKS

| Type | Why It Works | 2025 Case Examples |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Court transcripts/allocutions** | Sworn statements; judicial records; essentially undeniable | *Valentina v. Beckerman* |
| **Corporate charter/incorporation records** | Official government records; undisputed authenticity | *Jane Doe v. KIPP* |
| **Recorded deeds** | Public records; contents undeniable | *Karpovich* (precedent) |
| **Mortgages** | Transactional documents with undisputed authenticity | *Bank of N.Y. Mellon v. Kyung Lee* |
| **Signed contracts** | Clear, unambiguous terms that resolve issues | *Brooklyn Tabernacle v. Thor* |
| **Wage notices with electronic signatures** | Employee's own authenticated acknowledgment | *Granizo v. Krystal Fruits* |
| **Medical charts + facility policies** | Objective records establishing requirements | *Lara*; *Hyman* |
| **Collective bargaining agreements** | Formal contracts with clear terms | Various |

#### Characteristics of Successful Documentary Evidence:
- **Unambiguous** - Clear on its face
- **Authentic** - Undisputed origin
- **Undeniable** - Contents cannot be controverted
- **Dispositive** - Resolves all factual issues as matter of law

---

### Evidence That DOESN'T WORK

| Type | Why It Fails | 2025 Case Examples |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Affidavits** | Can be controverted by other affidavits | *Conte*; *Neptune Issue*; *Doggart* |
| **Emails** (2d Dept.) | Not "essentially undeniable"; disputable | *Bernstein v. Jacobson* |
| **Letters** | Not transactional documents; can be disputed | *Bernstein v. Jacobson* |
| **Deposition testimony** | Subject to interpretation and dispute | Multiple cases |
| **Disputed pay stubs/time records** | Accuracy in question = factual dispute | *Granizo* (partial denial) |
| **Verified complaints** | Plaintiff's own pleading isn't "undeniable" | Third Dept. precedent |
| **Attorney affirmations** | No personal knowledge of transactional facts | Various |

#### Why These Fail:
- **Deniable** - Can be contradicted by opposing evidence
- **Ambiguous** - Subject to interpretation
- **Raise factual issues** - Create disputed questions rather than resolve them
- **Lack authentication** - Origin or accuracy questioned

---

### Departmental Split on Emails

| Department | Position |
|------------|----------|
| **First Department** | Emails CAN qualify if they "clearly conclude that plaintiff's claim is factually untrue" |
| **Second Department** | Emails generally do NOT qualify - "not essentially undeniable" |

**Practice Tip:** In the Second Department, don't rely solely on emails for a CPLR 3211(a)(1) motion.

## Strategic Recommendations

### For Movants (Defendants):
- Lead with contracts, deeds, judicial records
- Avoid relying on affidavits as primary evidence
- In Second Department, don't rely on emails alone
- Ensure documents are properly authenticated
- Documents must be "case-determinative"

### For Opponents (Plaintiffs):
- Challenge whether evidence is truly "documentary"
- Point out any ambiguity in documents
- Argue affidavits/letters don't qualify
- Show documents don't "utterly refute" all allegations
- Request discovery under CPLR 3211(d) if facts may exist

---

## Key Takeaways from 2025 Cases

1. **Form matters as much as content**: Even if a document contains helpful facts, it must be the RIGHT TYPE of document

2. **Self-serving statements fail**: Defendants' own affidavits explaining their position are never sufficient

3. **Disputed accuracy = denial**: If the other side contests the accuracy of records, factual issues exist

4. **Electronic signatures work**: Courts accept e-signatures as authentic acknowledgments

5. **Objective records beat subjective ones**: Medical charts, corporate filings, and government records succeed; personal statements fail

6. **The "utterly refutes" bar is HIGH**: Mere contradiction isn't enough—the document must make plaintiff's version impossible
