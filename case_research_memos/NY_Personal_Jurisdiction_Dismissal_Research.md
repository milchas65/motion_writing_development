# MEMORANDUM

**TO:** File
**FROM:** Legal Research
**DATE:** January 1, 2026
**RE:** Publicly Available Sources for New York State Decisions on Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction (CPLR 3211(a)(8))

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum compiles publicly available resources for researching New York State court decisions on motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under CPLR 3211(a)(8).

### Key Takeaways

1. **Burden of Proof:** Plaintiff bears burden of demonstrating jurisdiction; must make prima facie showing to defeat motion to dismiss.

2. **CPLR 302(a)(1) - Low Threshold:** New York's long-arm statute is a "single act statute"—one purposeful transaction suffices. Physical presence NOT required (*Fischbarg*, *Vayu*).

3. **Foreign Corporation Registration:** Registration to do business in NY does NOT constitute consent to general jurisdiction (*Aybar* 2021). Governor Hochul vetoed S7476 that would have changed this.

4. **Waiver is Easy:** Personal jurisdiction defense MUST be raised in first responsive pleading or pre-answer motion, or it is waived. Extended delays (e.g., 3 years in *U.S. Bank v. Pepe*) constitute waiver.

5. **Commercial Torts:** For CPLR 302(a)(3), "injury" situs is where critical events occurred, NOT where financial loss happened. Pure economic loss in NY may be insufficient.

6. **Internet Contacts:** Passive websites insufficient; but solicitation of NY services or targeted marketing may establish jurisdiction.

## II. LANDMARK COURT OF APPEALS DECISIONS

### A. Aybar v. Aybar, 37 N.Y.3d 274 (2021)

**Citation:** 37 N.Y.3d 274, 177 N.E.3d 1253, 152 N.Y.S.3d 174 (2021)

**Full Text:** https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12052182773495866296

**Facts:** Plaintiffs sued Ford Motor Company and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company in New York following an automobile accident that occurred in Virginia. Neither defendant was incorporated in New York nor had its principal place of business in the state.

**Procedural History:** Ford and Goodyear moved to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8) for lack of personal jurisdiction. Supreme Court denied the motions, finding consent to general jurisdiction through registration. The Appellate Division reversed and granted the motions to dismiss.

**Holding:** The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that a foreign corporation does NOT consent to general personal jurisdiction in New York merely by registering to do business in the state and designating an agent for service of process.

**Key Principles:**
- Registration under the Business Corporation Law does not constitute consent to general jurisdiction
- The BCL contains no explicit language conditioning registration on consent to jurisdiction
- Overturned decades of *Bagdon v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.* precedent
- Registration-based jurisdiction would be "exorbitant" under modern due process standards

**Significance:** Major victory for out-of-state corporate defendants; significantly limited general jurisdiction in New York.

---

### B. State v. Vayu, Inc., 2023 N.Y. Slip Op. 801 (Feb. 14, 2023)

**Citation:** 39 N.Y.3d 330, 211 N.E.3d 67, 185 N.Y.S.3d 362 (2023)

**Full Text:** https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/court-of-appeals/2023/2.html

**Facts:** Vayu, Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Michigan, contracted with SUNY Stony Brook to provide unmanned aerial vehicles for use in Madagascar. The State of New York sued Vayu for breach of contract. Vayu's contacts with New York consisted of numerous telephone calls and emails over two years and one face-to-face meeting.

**Procedural History:** Vayu moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Lower courts granted the motion. The Court of Appeals reversed.

**Holding:** Vayu's telephone calls, emails, and single in-person meeting in New York were sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction under CPLR 302(a)(1).

**Key Principles:**
- CPLR 302(a)(1) is a "single act statute"
- Proof of one purposeful transaction in New York is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction
- Defendant need not physically enter New York if activities were purposeful
- Must be "substantial relationship" between the transaction and the claim asserted

**Dissent (Rivera, J.):** Expressed concern that the majority adopted an "overly broad reading and unconstitutional extension" of CPLR 302(a)(1).

**Significance:** Reaffirmed the relatively low bar for establishing specific personal jurisdiction over non-domiciliary defendants under New York's long-arm statute.

---

### C. Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, 20 N.Y.3d 327 (2012)

**Citation:** 20 N.Y.3d 327, 984 N.E.2d 893, 960 N.Y.S.2d 695 (2012)

**Holding:** Established the governing test for CPLR 302(a)(1) jurisdiction requiring demonstration of (1) transaction of business in New York, and (2) an "articulable nexus" between the business transacted and the cause of action.

**Key Principles:**
- Repeated use of New York banking facilities can constitute transaction of business
- The nexus requirement is less stringent than proximate cause
- Due process requires that defendant "purposefully availed" itself of forum benefits

---

### D. Longines-Wittnauer Watch Co. v. Barnes & Reinecke, 15 N.Y.2d 443 (1965)

**Significance:** Foundational case establishing that CPLR 302 rests on New York's inherent power to exercise jurisdiction over nonresidents who commit acts within the state, not on implied consent theory.

---

### E. Kreutter v. McFadden Oil Corp., 71 N.Y.2d 460 (1988)

**Citation:** 71 N.Y.2d 460, 527 N.Y.S.2d 195, 522 N.E.2d 40 (1988)

**Facts:** A New York corporation sued a non-resident salesman for breach of employment agreement. The salesman had traveled to New York to interview and negotiate the employment contract, but performed work exclusively in New England.

**Holding:** A single visit to New York to negotiate and enter into a contract can constitute "transacting business" for jurisdictional purposes under CPLR 302(a)(1).

**Key Principles:**
- CPLR 302(a)(1) is a "single act statute"
- Proof of one transaction in New York is sufficient to invoke jurisdiction
- Defendant need not physically enter New York if activities were purposeful
- Must be "substantial relationship" between the transaction and the claim
- Rejected the fiduciary shield doctrine

**Significance:** Foundational precedent establishing the "single act" nature of CPLR 302(a)(1) and the low threshold for establishing specific jurisdiction.

---

### F. Fischbarg v. Doucet, 9 N.Y.3d 375 (2007)

**Citation:** 9 N.Y.3d 375, 849 N.Y.S.2d 501, 880 N.E.2d 22 (2007)

**Full Text:** https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/court-of-appeals/2007/2007-09962.html

**Facts:** California defendants retained a New York attorney via telephone to represent them in Oregon federal court litigation. All communications occurred by phone, mail, fax, and email. Defendants never physically entered New York.

**Holding:** Defendants' retention and subsequent communications with plaintiff in New York established a continuing attorney-client relationship constituting the transaction of business under CPLR 302(a)(1).

**Key Principles:**
- Physical presence in New York is NOT required for jurisdiction
- "One need not be physically present [here] to be subject to the jurisdiction of our courts under CPLR 302"
- By soliciting NY legal services, defendants "projected themselves into New York's legal services market"
- "Lawyers and other professionals today transact business with their pens, their fax machines and their conference calls—not with their feet"

**Significance:** Key precedent for jurisdiction based on remote/electronic contacts with New York service providers.

### C. Third and Fourth Departments

*Note: Fewer published personal jurisdiction decisions from these departments in 2023-2024. Most CPLR 3211(a)(8) case law originates from the First and Second Departments due to higher commercial litigation volume in New York City.*

**Research Resources:**
- Third Department: https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/appellate-division-third-department/2024/

**Harrison v. Schottenstein (2d Dept. 2024)**
- Failure to properly serve process leaves court without personal jurisdiction
- All subsequent proceedings rendered null and void
- Process server's affidavit constitutes prima facie evidence of proper service

---

## IV. SUPREME COURT (TRIAL LEVEL) DECISIONS (2023-2024)

*Note: In New York, the Supreme Court is the trial-level court of general jurisdiction, not the highest court.*

- **Court:** NY County Commercial Division (Justice Joel M. Cohen)
- **Holding:** Granted defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction
- **Key Issue:** Whether contractual choice of law and arbitration clauses confer jurisdiction

- **Holding:** DENIED defendant RCBC's motion to dismiss

- **Significance:** Continues trend of NY courts asserting jurisdiction over foreign banks based on correspondent accounts

## V. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

### A. CPLR 3211(a)(8) - Motion to Dismiss

**Text:** A party may move for judgment dismissing one or more causes of action asserted against him on the ground that "the court has not jurisdiction of the person of the defendant."

**Full Statute:** https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/CVP/3211

### B. CPLR 302 - Long-Arm Statute

**Full Text:** https://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/cvp/article-3/302/

| Subsection | Jurisdictional Basis | Requirements |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 302(a)(1) | Transaction of business | Purposeful activity in NY + articulable nexus to claim |
| 302(a)(2) | Tortious act in NY | Physical tort committed within the state |
| 302(a)(3) | Tortious act outside NY causing injury in NY | Injury in NY + (regular business OR substantial revenue from NY) |
| 302(a)(4) | Real property | Ownership, use, or possession of NY real property |

### C. CPLR 301 - General Jurisdiction

Permits jurisdiction over defendants who are:
- Domiciled in New York
- Have "continuous and systematic" contacts substantial enough to be "at home" in NY

---

## VI. LEGAL STANDARDS AND BURDEN OF PROOF

### A. Burden Allocation

On a motion to dismiss pursuant to CPLR 3211(a)(8), the **plaintiff bears the burden** of demonstrating:
1. Satisfaction of statutory prerequisites (CPLR 301 or 302)
2. Compliance with constitutional due process requirements

### B. Prima Facie Standard

- Plaintiff meets burden by presenting affidavits and relevant documents
- Process server's affidavit of service constitutes prima facie evidence of proper service
- Bare denial of service insufficient to rebut prima facie showing

### C. Traverse Hearing

If defendant demonstrates factual issue regarding service or jurisdiction:
- Court may permit limited jurisdictional discovery
- Court may order immediate trial on jurisdictional facts (traverse hearing)

### D. Due Process Requirements

Even if statutory requirements are met, exercise of jurisdiction must:
- Comport with federal constitutional due process
- Satisfy "minimum contacts" analysis
- Not offend "traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice"

---

## VII. WAIVER OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION DEFENSE

### A. General Rule

Unlike subject matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction CAN be waived.

### B. Timing Requirements

Personal jurisdiction defense must be raised:
- In defendant's **first responsive pleading** (answer), OR
- By **pre-answer motion** under CPLR 3211(a)(8)

**Critical:** Defense must be defendant's "first move" or it is waived.

### C. Conduct Constituting Waiver

| Action | Waiver? |
|--------|---------|
| Filing answer without raising defense | YES |
| Filing notice of appearance only | NO (if motion follows promptly) |
| Asserting unrelated counterclaim | YES |
| Actively participating in proceedings | YES |
| Extended delay before raising defense | YES |

### D. Key Cases on Waiver

- **Lindsay Partners v. Young (2024):** Six-day delay between appearance and motion was acceptable
- **U.S. Bank v. Pepe:** Three-year delay constituted waiver
- **Matter of Limanov (2024):** Active participation in proceedings waived defense

---

## VIII. SPECIFIC JURISDICTION ANALYSIS (CPLR 302(a)(1))

### A. Two-Part Test

1. **Transaction of Business:** Defendant must have transacted business within New York
2. **Articulable Nexus:** Claim must arise from or relate to the NY business transaction

### B. Single Act Statute

- Proof of ONE purposeful transaction is sufficient
- Defendant need not physically enter New York
- Activities must be "purposeful"
- Must be "substantial relationship" between transaction and claim

### C. Factors Supporting Jurisdiction

- Contract negotiations in New York
- Communications directed to New York parties
- Performance of contract in New York
- Physical presence at meetings in New York
- Use of New York financial institutions

### D. Factors Against Jurisdiction

- Contract negotiated solely by mail/phone/fax without NY presence
- No purposeful direction of activities toward New York
- Mere awareness that counterparty is located in New York
- Passive website accessible from New York

---

## IX. TORTIOUS ACT JURISDICTION (CPLR 302(a)(2) AND (a)(3))

### A. CPLR 302(a)(2) - Tortious Act Within New York

**Statutory Text:** Jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary who "commits a tortious act within the state, except as to a cause of action for defamation of character arising from the act."

**Key Principles:**
- Requires the tortious act to be physically committed within New York
- No specified level of activity required—one tortious act suffices
- Plaintiff must suffer some damage as a result of the tort committed in NY
- Does NOT apply to defamation claims

**Recent Case: WCVAWCK-Doe v. Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Inc., 2023 NY Slip Op 02026 (2d Dept. Apr. 19, 2023)**
- Full Text: https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/appellate-division-second-department/2023/2021-06641.html
- Connecticut not-for-profit corporation subject to NY jurisdiction under CPLR 302(a)(2)
- Viewing allegations in light most favorable to plaintiff, defendant committed tortious act within New York
- Per *Honda Assoc., Inc.*: Section "requires no specified level of activity within the State"

### B. CPLR 302(a)(3) - Tortious Act Outside New York Causing Injury Within

**Statutory Text:** Jurisdiction over a non-domiciliary who "commits a tortious act without the state causing injury to person or property within the state" IF the defendant:
- (i) regularly does or solicits business in NY, OR engages in persistent course of conduct, OR derives substantial revenue from goods/services in NY; OR
- (ii) expects or should reasonably expect the act to have consequences in NY AND derives substantial revenue from interstate commerce

**Key Principles:**
- Two-part analysis: (1) tortious act outside NY causing injury inside, AND (2) one of the additional requirements
- For commercial torts (fraud, etc.): "situs of injury" is where original critical events occurred, NOT where financial loss happened
- Purely economic injury may be insufficient if the underlying events occurred elsewhere

**Recent Case: SOS Capital, LLC v. Recycling Paper Partners of PA, LLC, 2023 NY Slip Op 04480 (1st Dept. Aug. 31, 2023)**
- Full Text: https://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2023/2023_04480.htm
- Allegedly fraudulent electronic communications transmitted outside NY to a NY company are INSUFFICIENT for CPLR 302(a)(2) jurisdiction
- In commercial tort context, courts look to where "original critical events" took place
- Financial loss in NY alone does not establish "injury" for 302(a)(3) purposes

**Trotman v. Priority Auto, Inc. (2d Dept. 2024)**
- Plaintiff failed to demonstrate CPLR 302(a)(3) requirements
- Court analyzed whether defendants expected conduct to have NY consequences AND derived substantial revenue from interstate commerce

### C. Comparison Table

| Element | 302(a)(2) | 302(a)(3) |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Location of tortious act | WITHIN New York | OUTSIDE New York |
| Injury location | N/A (act in NY) | WITHIN New York |
| Additional requirements | None | Business activity OR interstate commerce |
| Defamation claims | EXCLUDED | May apply |
| Commercial tort situs | Physical location | Where critical events occurred |

### D. Practical Considerations for Commercial Torts

- Pure economic loss in NY (e.g., bank account debited) may NOT suffice for 302(a)(3)
- Courts examine where the "original critical events associated with the action or dispute took place"
- For fraud claims: focus on where misrepresentations were made, not where money was lost
- Plaintiff bears burden of demonstrating defendant's NY business activity or interstate commerce revenue

## X. INTERNET AND VIRTUAL CONTACTS

### A. General Framework

New York courts analyze internet contacts along traditional purposeful availment lines, not through a separate "internet jurisdiction" test. The key inquiry remains whether defendant "purposefully availed" itself of the benefits of New York law.

### B. Zippo Sliding Scale (Federal Courts)

Federal courts often apply the *Zippo* sliding scale:
- **Passive websites:** Information only = no jurisdiction
- **Interactive websites:** Depends on level of interactivity
- **Commercial websites:** Active transactions with forum residents = jurisdiction

### C. New York Approach

**Passive Websites Insufficient:**
- A "passive website" that merely imparts information without permitting a business transaction is generally insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction
- The mere fact that a plaintiff viewed a defendant's website in New York is insufficient to establish CPLR 302(a)(1) jurisdiction

**Electronic Communications May Suffice:**
- Per *Fischbarg v. Doucet* (2007): Solicitation of NY services and frequent communications by phone, fax, and email can establish jurisdiction
- "Lawyers and other professionals today transact business with their pens, their fax machines and their conference calls—not with their feet"

**Contracts Negotiated Remotely:**
- When a contract is negotiated via email or telephone and no business is performed within New York, the foreign defendant is generally NOT subject to personal jurisdiction
- However, if defendant "projects themselves" into New York's market, jurisdiction may attach

### D. Key Cases

**Deutsche Bank Sec. Inc. v. Montana Bd. of Invs., 21 A.D.3d 90 (1st Dept. 2005), aff'd 7 N.Y.3d 65 (2006)**
- Securities broker using instant messaging to "project himself" into New York was subject to jurisdiction
- Defendant's electronic communications targeted New York investors

**People v. JUUL Labs, Inc., 212 A.D.3d 414 (1st Dept. 2023)**
- Full Text: https://nycourts.gov/reporter/3dseries/2023/2023_00040.htm
- Court found personal jurisdiction over corporate officers based on in-person activities in NY related to marketing strategies
- Electronic marketing directed at NY consumers supported jurisdiction

**Fischbarg v. Doucet, 9 N.Y.3d 375 (2007)**
- See Section II.F for full analysis
- California defendants subject to NY jurisdiction based solely on phone, fax, and email contacts with NY attorney

### E. Practical Considerations

| Contact Type | Likely Sufficient? | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Passive website viewable in NY | NO | Information only |
| Interactive website with NY transactions | MAYBE | Depends on volume and purposefulness |
| Direct emails/calls to NY party | MAYBE | Must be purposeful and related to claim |
| Contract negotiated remotely, performed elsewhere | NO | Generally insufficient |
| Solicitation of NY professional services | YES | Per *Fischbarg* |
| Targeted marketing to NY consumers | YES | Per *JUUL Labs*|

## XI. FOREIGN CORPORATION JURISDICTION

### A. Current State of Law (Post-Aybar)

- Registration to do business in NY does NOT equal consent to general jurisdiction
- Designation of agent for service does NOT confer general jurisdiction
- Specific jurisdiction under CPLR 302 remains available based on NY activities

### B. U.S. Supreme Court: Mallory v. Norfolk Southern (2023)

**Citation:** 600 U.S. 122 (2023)

**Holding:** Upheld Pennsylvania's consent-by-registration statute as constitutional under Due Process Clause.

**Significance:** Created circuit split; Pennsylvania-style consent statutes are permissible but not required.

### C. New York Legislative Response

**Senate Bill S7476 (2023)**
- Would have required foreign corporations to consent to general jurisdiction as condition of registration
- Passed both Senate and Assembly
- **VETOED by Governor Hochul** (December 22, 2023)
- Bill Text: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S7476

**Veto Rationale:** Governor expressed concern that proposal would "represent a massive expansion of New York's law governing general jurisdiction, likely deterring out-of-state companies from doing business in New York."

### D. Current Status

*Aybar* remains controlling law in New York. However, given *Mallory* and legislative attempts to overturn *Aybar*, practitioners should monitor for future developments.
