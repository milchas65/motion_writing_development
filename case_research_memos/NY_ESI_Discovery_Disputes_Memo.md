**RE:**      Recent New York State Court Decisions on ESI (Electronically Stored Information) Discovery Disputes

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum summarizes recent decisions from New York State courts addressing discovery disputes involving Electronically Stored Information (ESI). The cases cover issues including native format production, litigation hold failures, spoliation sanctions, cost shifting, text message preservation, and social media discovery.

---

## II. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. Fourth Department

#### 1. Buffalo Biodiesel, Inc. v. Blue Bridge Fin., LLC
**2024 NY Slip Op 03259 | Fourth Department | June 14, 2024**

The plaintiff commenced an action for libel and tortious interference arising from allegations that the defendant sent a false email to a financial services company. During discovery, defendant sought copies of all communications between plaintiff and the financial services company.

**ESI Preservation Failure:** Plaintiff revealed that it had failed to issue a litigation hold and that all of its emails were deleted during the pendency of the action, either by plaintiff itself or, upon plaintiff's approval, by the company hosting its server. When plaintiff attempted to subpoena the deleted emails from the financial services company, that company was no longer operating and the emails could not be recovered.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court granted defendant's motion for spoliation sanctions pursuant to CPLR 3126, striking the complaint and dismissing plaintiff's remaining causes of action with prejudice. The Fourth Department affirmed.

**Key Rulings:**
- Plaintiff's failure to "suspend the routine deletion of its emails during the course of litigation" constituted "grossly negligent spoliation of evidence"
- While striking a pleading is generally limited to "instances of willful or contumacious conduct," it may also be warranted where negligent destruction of relevant evidence leaves a party "prejudicially bereft of the means of proving [its] claim or defense"
- "It is the peculiarity of spoliation cases that the very destruction of the evidence diminishes the ability of the deprived party to prove relevance directly"

**Significance:** Courts will not accept ignorance of online technology and email communications as a defense to spoliation. Litigation counsel must have competent technology resources to preserve evidence.

---

### B. First Department

#### 2. Barons Media, LLC v. Shapiro Legal Group, PLLC
**2024 NY Slip Op 05301 | First Department | October 24, 2024**

A non-party sought reimbursement of "reasonable production expenses" incurred while producing ESI pursuant to a subpoena.

**Holding:** The First Department limited the non-party's recovery to two-thirds of the requested expenses.

**Key Rulings:**
- Under the Commercial Division's ESI Guidelines, "reasonable production costs" may include reasonable fees charged by outside counsel and e-discovery consultants for gathering and reviewing documents for relevance and privilege before production
- However, "insofar as some of the entries reflect activities associated with withholding materials," these costs were not reimbursable
- Non-parties may not be fully reimbursed for costs incurred from withholding information from the requesting party

**Significance:** Attorneys for non-party witnesses should be aware that costs associated with withholding documents (as opposed to producing them) may not be recoverable as "reasonable production expenses."

---

## III. NEW YORK COUNTY COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 3. Zuckerbrot v. Gellis Lande
**Index No. 655110/2020 | Justice Joel M. Cohen | March 6, 2024**

The defendant produced "screenshots" of electronically stored information from her social media accounts rather than native format ESI.

**Holding:** The court rejected the defendant's production as insufficient.

**Key Rulings:**
- "Screenshots are not native ESI nor are they complete records" (citing *Simons v. Petrarch LLC* and *Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC*)
- Defendant must provide relevant ESI in its native format, or alternatively provide authorization(s) to facilitate access to the pertinent accounts
- If Meta or any other relevant custodian determines that native ESI is unavailable, defendant must provide plaintiffs' expert with access to her electronic devices for forensic examination
- The parties must engage in good-faith efforts to establish a protocol for the search and retrieval of ESI, including identifying search terms and a relevant time frame

**Significance:** As the universe of ESI expands, so do litigants' discovery obligations. Merely producing screenshots of messages or posts that are otherwise available in native format is insufficient.

---

#### 4. Joseph v. Rassi
**2024 NY Slip Op 30101(U) | Justice Ruchelsman (Kings County) | January 2, 2024**

The plaintiff moved to compel production of all text messages of the defendants relevant to the lawsuit. The defendants opposed on grounds that production of text messages for eight devices would be prohibitively expensive, potentially costing almost $50,000.

**Holding:** The court ordered the plaintiff and defendant to share the cost of ESI production.

**Key Ruling:** Where ESI production costs are substantial, courts may order cost-sharing between the parties rather than placing the entire burden on the producing party.

**Significance:** Demonstrates the Commercial Division's willingness to apply proportionality principles and cost-shifting to address the expense of text message production.

---

#### 5. SG575 Holdings LLC v. Richard Stuyvesant Holdings
**Justice Margaret A. Chan | January 2024**

The defendants repeatedly failed to comply with court orders, missing discovery deadlines three times and failing to produce any ESI, offering no excuse until after plaintiff filed for sanctions.

**Holding:** The court granted both defendants' motion to dismiss on other grounds AND plaintiff's request for sanctions for discovery violations.

**Key Rulings:**
- "If the credibility of court orders and the integrity of our judicial system are to be maintained, a litigant cannot ignore court orders with impunity"
- Discovery sanctions may be imposed even when other relief is granted to the sanctioned party
- Repeated failure to produce ESI without excuse warrants monetary sanctions

**Significance:** Courts will impose sanctions for ESI discovery failures even when granting other relief to the non-compliant party.

---

#### 6. Earthlink, LLC v. Charter Communications Operating, LLC
**Justice Andrea Masley | January 18, 2024**

The defendant failed to preserve recordings of customer calls despite pending litigation.

**Holding:** Spoliation sanctions granted.

**Key Rulings:**
- The court rejected Charter's claim that preserving recordings of millions of calls over several months was "impossible"
- Parties must implement adequate litigation holds upon notice of potential litigation
- "Impossibility" defense scrutinized carefully

**Significance:** Courts will not accept blanket claims of impossibility for ESI preservation; parties must demonstrate specific, credible reasons why preservation was not feasible.

---

## IV. FEDERAL COURTS IN NEW YORK (2024)

#### 7. We The Protesters, Inc. v. Sinyangwe
**S.D.N.Y. | March 2024**

The court resolved a discovery dispute regarding whether plaintiffs could properly redact text messages based on responsiveness without an express agreement between the parties' counsel.

**Key Ruling:** The decision "underscore[d] the importance of counsel fashioning clear and comprehensive agreements when navigating the perils and pitfalls of electronic discovery."

**Significance:** Parties should establish clear, mutually agreeable protocols for handling ESI discovery, particularly regarding text messages, with an eye toward proportionality and efficiency.

---

#### 8. Kosher Ski Tours Inc. v. Okemo Limited Liability Co.
**S.D.N.Y. | July 2024**

The defendant added relevant custodians to its document hold three days after their ESI was deleted.

**Holding:** The court granted spoliation sanctions but declined to find that plaintiff established intent to deprive because defendant presented credible explanations for the delay.

**Key Ruling:** Spoliation sanctions may be appropriate even without intent to deprive where the failure to preserve caused prejudice.

**Significance:** Demonstrates the importance of promptly implementing litigation holds; even short delays can result in sanctions if ESI is lost.

---

#### 9. Miramontes v. Peraton Inc.
**2024**

In this employment discrimination case, plaintiff moved for sanctions for defendant's failure to preserve text messages and a skills assessment related to plaintiff's performance.

**Key Issue:** Defendant argued that because the texts were on an employee's personal phone, and it therefore lacked control of the phone, it did not have a duty to preserve the messages.

**Holding:** Sanctions imposed. The court denied defendant's motion for summary judgment and granted additional discovery for plaintiff.

**Key Rulings:**
- Control over personal devices is a crucial issue in text message preservation
- Sanctions cannot be harsher than necessary to address the need to punish or deter and to address the impact on discovery
- Legal hold notices should expressly include text messages and any other source of ESI that may be relevant

**Significance:** BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies complicate preservation obligations. Litigation holds must expressly extend to personal devices used for work, and strict compliance must be monitored.

---

## V. SOCIAL MEDIA ESI DISCOVERY

### A. Governing Principles

**Forman v. Henkin (Court of Appeals, 2018)** established the foundational rule that even materials deemed "private" by a social media user are subject to discovery if they contain material relevant to the issues in controversy.

**Key Holdings:**
- The Court of Appeals "explicitly rejected the notion that the account holder's so-called 'privacy' settings govern the scope of disclosure of social media materials"
- Discovery is permitted if the evidence requested is "reasonably calculated to contain evidence material and necessary to the litigation"
- Requests for social media data must be narrowly targeted; courts will not permit discovery of "all" postings or "entire" account data

### B. Metadata Discovery

**Vasquez-Santos v. Mathew (Appellate Division, 2019)** permitted discovery of Facebook photo metadata where plaintiff claimed photos were older than defendant alleged.

### C. 2024 Application

**Zuckerbrot v. Gellis Lande** (discussed above) applied these principles to require native format production of social media ESI, not mere screenshots.

---

## VI. COMMERCIAL DIVISION ESI RULES (RULE 11-c)

### A. Proportionality Standard

Rule 11-c provides that "the costs and burdens of discovery of ESI shall be proportionate to its benefits, considering the nature of the dispute, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the materials requested to resolving the dispute."

A court may:
- Deny or modify disproportionate requests
- Order disclosure on condition that the requesting party advance the reasonable cost of production, subject to allocation in the final judgment

### B. Cost Shifting Framework

**General Rule:** The producing party bears the cost of searching for, retrieving, and producing ESI.

**Exception:** Courts may shift costs between parties under appropriate circumstances, applying the seven *Zubulake* factors:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Extent to which the request is specifically tailored to discover relevant information |
| 2 | Availability of such information from other sources |
| 3 | Total cost of production compared to the amount in controversy |
| 4 | Total cost of production compared to the resources available to each party |
| 5 | Relative ability of each party to control costs and its incentive to do so |
| 6 | Importance of the issues at stake in the litigation |
| 7 | Relative benefits to the parties of obtaining the information |

### C. Production Format Requirements

- Requesting party may specify the format in which ESI is produced
- Responding party has the right to object to such a request
- ESI may be produced in "native form" (the form in which information was originally created and maintained)
- Screenshots and printouts are generally insufficient substitutes for native format

### D. Non-Party Production Costs

Under CPLR 3111 and 3122(d), the requesting party shall promptly defray the reasonable expenses associated with a non-party's production of ESI.

"Reasonable production expenses" may include:
- Fees charged by outside counsel and e-discovery consultants
- Costs to identify, preserve, collect, process, host, review for relevance and privilege, and produce ESI

However, per *Barons Media* (2024), costs associated with withholding documents may not be recoverable.

---

## VII. ESI PROTOCOL REQUIREMENTS

### A. ESI Stipulation

Parties are often required to submit a stipulation on the protocol for discovery of ESI addressing:
- Scope of preservation obligations
- Search terms and date ranges
- Production format (native, PDF, TIFF, etc.)
- Metadata to be produced
- Privilege log format
- Cost allocation

### B. Litigation Hold Best Practices

Based on 2024 case law, litigation holds should:
- Be issued promptly upon reasonable anticipation of litigation
- Be in writing (oral holds may be insufficient)
- Expressly include text messages and other mobile ESI
- Extend to personal devices used for work (BYOD)
- Include verification of compliance
- Suspend routine deletion/purging of relevant data

---

## VIII. 2024 RULE UPDATES

### A. Joint Local Rules Amendment (E.D.N.Y. & S.D.N.Y.)
**Effective July 1, 2024**

Local Rule 26.2(c) was amended to address the potential use of categorical or metadata privilege logs instead of document-by-document logs:
- "When appropriate, parties should consider and discuss the use of a categorical log or a metadata log, instead of a document-by-document log"
- A party cannot object to a privilege log solely because it is categorical, but may object if substantive information is not provided in comprehensible form

### B. NY Uniform Civil Rules Amendment
**Effective December 2, 2024**

Parties and nonparties should adhere to the ESI guidelines set forth in Appendix A to the Commercial Division Rules.

---

## IX. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Litigation Holds Are Critical:** Failure to issue a litigation hold and suspend routine data deletion constitutes grossly negligent spoliation warranting severe sanctions (Buffalo Biodiesel).

2. **Native Format Required:** Screenshots of ESI are insufficient; parties must produce ESI in native format or provide access to accounts/devices (Zuckerbrot v. Gellis Lande).

3. **Text Messages Require Special Attention:** Litigation holds must expressly include text messages on both company and personal devices (Miramontes v. Peraton).

4. **Cost Shifting Is Available:** Courts may order cost-sharing for expensive ESI production, particularly for text messages from multiple devices (Joseph v. Rassi).

5. **Non-Party Costs Have Limits:** Non-parties may recover ESI production costs, but not costs associated with withholding documents (Barons Media v. Shapiro).

6. **Impossibility Claims Scrutinized:** Courts will not accept blanket claims that ESI preservation was impossible without specific, credible evidence (Earthlink v. Charter).

7. **Establish Clear ESI Protocols:** Parties should fashion clear, comprehensive agreements for ESI discovery, including provisions for text messages, redactions, and format (We The Protesters v. Sinyangwe).

8. **Promptly Implement Holds:** Even short delays in implementing litigation holds can result in sanctions if ESI is lost (Kosher Ski Tours v. Okemo).

9. **Social Media Is Discoverable:** Privacy settings do not govern discoverability; relevant social media content is subject to discovery in native format (Forman v. Henkin; Zuckerbrot).

10. **BYOD Complicates Preservation:** Personal devices used for work must be included in litigation holds; lack of "control" over the device is not a complete defense (Miramontes v. Peraton).
