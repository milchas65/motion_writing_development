---

## I. INTRODUCTION

## II. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. Second Department

#### 1. Joseph v. Rassi
**Appellate Division, Second Department | September 25, 2024**

In this action to recover damages for breach of fiduciary duty, the plaintiff moved to compel the defendants to produce a document-by-document privilege log in conformity with CPLR 3122(b).

**Holding:** The court granted the motion to compel. The defendants' privilege log failed to individually identify each type of document being withheld, the general subject matter of each document, and the date of each document.

**Key Ruling:** Commercial Division Rule 11-b(b) does not authorize the unilateral use of categorical designations in a privilege log absent an agreement by the parties or a protective order. Parties must produce document-by-document privilege logs unless otherwise agreed or ordered.

#### 2. Holloway v. Orthodox Church in America
**Appellate Division, Second Department | November 20, 2024**

In an action for negligent hiring, retention, and supervision, the plaintiff moved to compel the defendant Orthodox Church in America to produce the personnel file of the third-party defendant. The Church opposed and the third-party defendant cross-moved for a protective order.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court properly granted the plaintiff's motion to compel and directed production of the personnel file, subject to certain redactions.

**Key Ruling:** "Parties are entitled to disclosure of all matter material and necessary to prosecution of the action" (CPLR 3101[a]). Personnel records are generally discoverable where a plaintiff alleges a cause of action for negligent hiring, retention, or supervision. The test is one of "usefulness and reason."

#### 3. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Evanson
**Appellate Division, Second Department | September 11, 2024**

In a mortgage foreclosure action, the defendant served discovery demands on the plaintiff, and the plaintiff failed to respond. Three months later, the defendant served the demands again with a letter threatening to move to strike. The defendant then moved to strike the complaint under CPLR 3126(3) without first moving to compel.

**Holding:** The motion court properly denied the motion to strike.

**Key Ruling:** Absent "exigent circumstances," prior to seeking the involvement of the court to resolve a discovery dispute, counsel must confer and make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute pursuant to 22 NYCRR 202.7 and 202.20-f. A party should move to compel under CPLR 3124 before seeking the drastic remedy of striking a pleading under CPLR 3126.

---

### B. First Department

#### 4. Lane's Floor Coverings & Interiors, Inc. v. DiLalla
**Appellate Division, First Department | April 25, 2024**

The plaintiff cross-moved to compel discovery and for discovery sanctions.

**Holding:** The court modified the lower court order and remanded to the motion court for a determination of plaintiff's cross-motion to compel and for sanctions.

**Significance:** This decision demonstrates the appellate courts' willingness to ensure that discovery disputes are properly adjudicated at the trial level.

---

## III. NEW YORK COUNTY COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 5. Bangladesh Bank v. Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation
**Index No. 652051/2024 | Justice Andrea Masley | December 21, 2024**

The plaintiff moved to compel a Filipino bank to collect and search documents from one of its in-house counsel.

**Holding:** Motion to compel granted.

**Key Ruling:** The bank's claim that the information possessed by its lawyer would be privileged did not shield the documents from production. The court ordered the bank to collect and search documents from its in-house counsel despite the privilege objection.

---

#### 6. Richmond Global Compass Fund Management GP, LLC v. Decio Nascimento
**Justice Andrew Borrok | March 5, 2024**

The plaintiff moved to compel discovery and to declassify certain information marked by the defendants as "Attorneys' Eyes Only."

**Holding:** Motion to compel granted. The "Attorneys' Eyes Only" designation was declassified.

**Key Ruling:** Defendants could not limit the provision of certain information solely to the plaintiff's attorney, even where defendants claimed fear that the plaintiff would use that information to tortiously interfere with defendants' current and prospective business relations.

---

#### 7. Conca Tekiner Chelsea v. Yasemin Tekiner
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | December 4, 2024**

The plaintiff moved to compel the production of documents in defendant's possession.

**Holding:** Motion to compel granted in part.

**Key Ruling:** Documents in defendant's possession are discoverable regardless of whether the defendant possessed them in a "personal" capacity or from acting as a trustee. The capacity in which documents are held does not shield them from discovery.

---

#### 8. Law Office of Mark S. Helweil v. Karambelas
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | March 13, 2024**

The plaintiffs moved to compel a deposition of the defendant.

**Holding:** Motion to compel denied without prejudice.

**Significance:** The denial without prejudice indicates that procedural deficiencies may be cured in a renewed motion.

---

#### 9. Zuckerbrot v. Gellis Lande
**Justice Joel M. Cohen | March 6, 2024**

The plaintiff challenged defendant's production of "screenshots" of electronically stored information (ESI) from social media accounts rather than native format ESI.

**Holding:** Motion to compel native format production granted.

**Key Ruling:** Screenshots of social media are insufficient to satisfy ESI production obligations. Native format ESI production is required absent agreement or court order to the contrary.

---

#### 10. Novum Energy Trading Inc. v. Transmontaigne Operating Co. L.P.
**Index No. 655283/2023 | Justice Margaret A. Chan | August 27, 2024**

The defendant served eight Requests for Admission. The plaintiff challenged the propriety of the requests.

**Holding:** Seven of eight Requests for Admission struck as improper.

**Key Ruling:** Requests for Admission that seek admission of disputed facts and ultimate issues are improper and will be struck.

---

## IV. OTHER TRIAL COURT DECISIONS

#### 11. Kastel Renaissance Interiors, Inc. v. Cholera
**2024 NY Slip Op 50434(U)**

The defendants moved under CPLR 3124 to compel plaintiff to provide discovery and under CPLR 3126 for discovery sanctions.

**Holding:** Motion granted in part and denied in part as academic.

---

#### 12. Aaron v. State of New York
**Court of Claims | Judge Chaudhry | February 14, 2025 (UID 2024-062-058)**

The claimant moved to compel document production.

**Holding:** Motion to compel denied.

**Key Ruling:** A party cannot be compelled to produce what does not exist. The claimant failed to demonstrate the relevancy of the requested documents or that such documents actually exist. Attempts to use document discovery as a means to test whether unknown documents exist constitute an "impermissible fishing expedition."

---

## V. THIRD-PARTY SUBPOENA AND INTERNATIONAL DISCOVERY

#### 13. People v. Trump
**May 10, 2024 (2024 NY Slip Op 50638(U))**

A motion was made to compel compliance with a subpoena.

**Holding:** Subpoena quashed in its entirety.

**Key Ruling:** To sustain a subpoena, the issuing party must demonstrate "that the testimony or evidence sought is reasonably likely to be relevant and material to the proceedings and that the subpoena is not overbroad or unreasonably burdensome." The subpoena at issue was "far too broad and seeks general discovery."

---

#### 14. South32 Chile Copper Holdings Pty Ltd. v. Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd.
**Justice Robert R. Reed | 2024**

The plaintiff sought international discovery from a non-party in a foreign jurisdiction.

**Holding:** The court addressed procedures for international discovery via the Hague Convention of 1970.

**Key Ruling:** A litigant in the New York Commercial Division seeking pre-trial discovery from a non-party in a foreign jurisdiction can apply to the court for issuance of a "Letter of Request for Judicial Assistance" under the Hague Convention, which has been signed by over 60 countries.

---

## VI. KEY PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

### A. Good Faith Conferral

Before filing a motion to compel, counsel must confer with opposing counsel in a good faith effort to resolve the issues raised by the motion. See 22 NYCRR § 202.20-f; 22 NYCRR § 202.7(c). A motion to compel must be accompanied by an affidavit of good faith setting forth in detail the efforts made to resolve the discovery dispute without court intervention.

### B. Timing

There is no provision of the CPLR, Uniform Rules, or Commercial Division Rules restricting the time to bring a motion to compel. However, a restriction may be embodied in a scheduling order resulting from a Preliminary Conference.

### C. Venue

The county in which a deposition is being taken or where records to be inspected are located may be treated as the county where the action is pending for purposes of a motion to compel under CPLR 3125.

### D. Scope

Under CPLR 3101(a), parties are entitled to "full disclosure of all matter material and necessary in the prosecution or defense of an action." The test is one of "usefulness and reason."

## VII. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Privilege Logs Must Be Specific:** Document-by-document privilege logs are required under CPLR 3122(b) unless the parties agree otherwise or a protective order is issued (Joseph v. Rassi).

2. **Personnel Files Are Discoverable:** In negligent hiring/retention cases, personnel records are generally discoverable (Holloway v. Orthodox Church).

3. **Confer Before Filing:** Parties must confer in good faith before seeking court intervention; failure to do so will result in denial (Bayview Loan Servicing).

4. **Native Format ESI Required:** Screenshots are insufficient; native format production is expected for ESI (Zuckerbrot v. Gellis Lande).

5. **AEO Designations Can Be Challenged:** "Attorneys' Eyes Only" designations may be declassified where the designating party cannot show legitimate need (Richmond Global).

6. **Documents Must Exist:** A party cannot be compelled to produce documents that do not exist; speculative requests are impermissible fishing expeditions (Aaron v. State).

7. **Subpoenas Must Be Tailored:** Overbroad subpoenas seeking general discovery will be quashed (People v. Trump).

8. **Capacity Irrelevant:** Documents are discoverable regardless of the capacity in which they are held (Conca Tekiner).
