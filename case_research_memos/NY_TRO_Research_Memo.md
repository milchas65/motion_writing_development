## I. On-Point TRO Decisions — Cases Expressly Granting or Denying TROs

This section contains New York State court decisions that expressly address orders to show cause seeking temporary restraining orders, with decisions expressly granting or denying those requests.

### A. Cases Expressly GRANTING TROs

#### 1. Vision Biobanc Holdings LLC v. Derek R. Taller (Commercial Division, Oct. 2024)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | Index No. 651706/2024 |
| **Court** | NY Supreme Court, Commercial Division (NY County) |
| **Judge** | Justice Margaret A. Chan |
| **Date** | October 15, 2024 |
| **Holding** | **Preliminary injunction GRANTED** barring defendant from acting for company or transferring funds |

**Key Facts:**
- Members holding over 70% of membership interests voted to remove Taller as CEO/Chairperson
- Upon learning of ouster, Taller allegedly attempted to transfer $550,000 from company accounts
- Taller blocked company's access to accounts and impeded vendor payments

**Court's Reasoning:**
1. **Likelihood of Success:** Clear right to relief where supermajority voted to remove defendant and establish new board; no "control dispute" existed
2. **Irreparable Harm:** Defendant's conduct threatened company's viability as ongoing concern; chaos could not be remedied by monetary damages
3. **Balance of Equities:** Favored plaintiff given 70%+ member vote against defendant and his documented harmful actions

#### 5. Airey v. State of New York (Renewable Energy Assessment, 2024-2025)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2025 NY Slip Op 25054 |
| **Court** | NY Supreme Court |
| **Judge** | Corcoran, J. |

#### 6. NAP IV LLC v. Qube USA LLC (Cannabis Dispensary, May 2024)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | Index No. 651937/2024 |
| **Court** | NY Supreme Court, Commercial Division (NY County) |
| **Judge** | Justice Margaret A. Chan |
| **Date** | May 31, 2024 |
| **Holding** | **Preliminary injunction DENIED** |

**Key Facts:**
- Plaintiff sought to prevent defendants from opening cannabis dispensary
- Claimed defendants misappropriated trade secrets (location information)

**Court's Reasoning:**
1. **No Trade Secret:** Location and landlord identity were "well known outside the business" through brokers, landlord representatives, and public "For Lease" sign
2. **Inadequate Protective Measures:** Plaintiff failed to obtain NDAs from involved parties or seek exclusivity agreements
3. **No Connection Between Remedy and Harm:** "An injunction against defendants' opening would do nothing to keep other people from knowing the address"
4. **Opportunity Loss Already Occurred:** Any opportunity "vanished the moment the Landlord and defendants signed the February Lease"

**Key Quote:** "There is no irreparable harm, and therefore no reason to enjoin."

#### 7. BR Fund IV v. Brightwood Capital Fund III (Commercial Division, Aug. 2024)

| **Court** | NY Supreme Court, Commercial Division |
| **Judge** | Justice Margaret A. Chan |
| **Date** | August 20, 2024 |
| **Holding** | **Preliminary injunction DENIED** |

**Key Facts:**
- Two investment funds sought preliminary injunction for specific performance
- Sought to compel closing of purchase agreement
- Motion actually sought mandatory injunction requiring ultimate relief in case

**Court's Reasoning:**
1. **Heightened Standard:** Because plaintiffs sought mandatory injunction, heightened standard of review applied
2. **Failed to Show Success on Merits:** Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate "reasonable probability of success on the merits"
3. **Factual Disputes:** Defendants raised factual disputes about whether their alleged breaches constituted "primary cause of the failure of the consummation of the transaction"
4. **Other Elements Not Reached:** Court stated "remaining issues of the parties' respective arguments on irreparable harm...and balance of the equities are academic"

### C. Cases Addressing TRO Erroneously Struck or Denied

#### 10. Wharton-Bickley v. 388 Broadway Owners LLC (Yellowstone — 1st Dept., 2025)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | Case No. 2024-00605; Index No. 154534/23 |
| **Court** | Appellate Division, First Department |
| **Lower Court** | Supreme Court, NY County (Nock, J.) |
| **Date** | February 2025 |
| **Holding** | **REVERSED** — injunctive relief granted **nunc pro tunc** as of May 18, 2023 |

**Key Facts:**
- Commercial tenant sought Yellowstone injunction to toll cure period
- Proposed order to show cause contained TRO clause tolling cure period and enjoining termination
- Supreme Court executed OSC on May 22, 2023 but **struck out the TRO clause without explanation**
- With cure period exhausted, landlord terminated lease as of May 31, 2023
- By time Supreme Court decided motion, there was no extant lease

**Court's Reasoning:**

1. **Error to Strike TRO Without Explanation:** "The court gave no explanation for this critical action, which allowed the cure period to lapse"

2. **Precedent for Nunc Pro Tunc Relief:** "Both the First Department and the Second Department have encountered the precise situation we face here: Supreme Court's striking of a plaintiff's request for Yellowstone TRO relief, leading to the expiration of the cure period, and the termination of the lease. In those rare instances, upon finding that TRO relief was timely sought and erroneously denied, the courts afforded the plaintiffs injunctive relief nunc pro tunc"

3. **Preservation of Property Interests:** Retroactive relief necessary "to preserve tenant's substantial property interests in their leases"

**Key Quote:** "In a seemingly uncommon move, Supreme Court struck the TRO clause, which led to the running of the cure period and the termination of the lease."

**Significance:** Establishes that when a Yellowstone TRO is erroneously struck or denied without explanation, appellate courts may grant relief nunc pro tunc to the date of the original order to show cause.

### D. Statutory Framework

#### NY Uniform Voidable Transactions Act (UVTA) — DCL Article 10
*(Applies to transfers after April 4, 2020)*

| Section | Type | Elements |
|---------|------|----------|
| **DCL § 273(a)** | Actual Fraud | Intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors |
| **DCL § 273(b)** | Constructive Fraud | Transfer without reasonably equivalent value + debtor insolvent |
| **DCL § 274** | Present Creditor | Transfer to insider within 1 year |
| **DCL § 276** | Remedies | Avoidance, attachment, injunction, receiver, other relief |

#### Remedies Under DCL § 276
A creditor may obtain:
1. **Avoidance** of the transfer
2. **Attachment** of the transferred asset
3. **Injunction** against further disposition
4. **Appointment of receiver** to take charge of assets
5. **Any other relief** the circumstances require

### E. "Badges of Fraud" — DCL § 273(b)

Courts consider these 11 factors to infer fraudulent intent:

| # | Badge | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Insider transfer | Transfer to family member, related entity |
| 2 | Retained control | Debtor keeps possession/control after transfer |
| 3 | Concealment | Transfer was hidden from creditors |
| 4 | Pending litigation | Debtor had been sued or threatened |
| 5 | Substantially all assets | Transfer of most/all assets |
| 6 | Absconding | Debtor fled or hid |
| 7 | Removed/concealed assets | Physical removal or hiding |
| 8 | Inadequate consideration | Value received not reasonably equivalent |
| 9 | Insolvency | Debtor was/became insolvent |
| 10 | Timing | Transfer shortly before/after substantial debt |
| 11 | Lienor transfer | Transfer to lienor who then transferred to insider |

**Multiple badges = stronger inference of fraud**

### F. Standards for Injunctive Relief in Fraudulent Conveyance Cases

From Schneider v. Pine Mgt. (2024):

To obtain an injunction, plaintiff must show:
1. **Violation** of a right (or threatened violation)
2. **No adequate remedy at law**
3. **Serious and irreparable harm** absent injunction
4. **Balance of equities** favors plaintiff

### G. Limitations Periods

| Claim Type | Statute | Period |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Actual fraud (§ 273(a)(1)) | UVTA | 4 years + 1 year from discovery |
| Constructive fraud | UVTA | 4 years from transfer |
| Insider transfers (§ 274(b)) | UVTA | 1 year from transfer |
| Pre-April 2020 transfers | Former DCL | 6 years |

### E. How SEC Asset Freezes Work

1. **Ex Parte Application:** SEC goes to federal court without notice to defendant
2. **Standard:** Must convince judge there is risk of asset dissipation
3. **Scope:** Freezes brokerage accounts, bank accounts, and traceable assets in others' names
4. **Duration:** Typically until preliminary injunction hearing or settlement

**Key Factors for Granting Asset Freeze:**
- Evidence of ongoing fraud
- Risk of dissipation (offshore transfers, spending, hiding)
- Need to preserve assets for disgorgement/restitution

---

### F. Mareva Injunctions (Prejudgment Asset Freezes)

**General Rule:** *Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo v. Alliance Bond Fund* (1999) held federal courts cannot issue Mareva-style freezes for pure contract/money damage claims.

**Exceptions Where Freezes ARE Available:**
1. Cases where Rule 65 does not apply
2. Cases involving equitable claims (fraud, breach of fiduciary duty)
3. "Mixed cases" with both legal and equitable relief
4. SEC enforcement actions under securities statutes
