**RE:** New York County Commercial Division — Orders to Show Cause: Procedural Rules and Case Decisions

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum summarizes publicly available information regarding orders to show cause (OSC) in the New York County Commercial Division, including procedural requirements, recent case decisions where preliminary injunctions and TROs were granted or denied, and relevant legal standards.

---

## II. PROCEDURAL FRAMEWORK

### A. When Orders to Show Cause Are Appropriate

In the Civil Branch and the Commercial Division, motions shall be brought on by order to show cause **only** when:

1. There is **genuine urgency** (e.g., applications for provisional relief)
2. A **stay** is required
3. A **statute mandates** proceeding by OSC

*See* 22 NYCRR § 202.70 (Rules of the Commercial Division).

### B. Filing Requirements

1. **Location:** In New York County, ex parte applications are submitted to the Ex Parte Office (Room 315), **except** in Commercial Division cases, which go to the Commercial Division Support Office (Room 119A).

2. **E-Filing:** Proposed orders to show cause and supporting documents in all NYSCEF cases must be submitted first by filing with NYSCEF. The Clerk normally reviews within 24 hours.

3. **CPLR 2217(b) Compliance:** Because an OSC is sought ex parte, it must be accompanied by an affidavit complying with CPLR 2217(b).

4. **22 NYCRR § 202.7(f) Notice:** The moving party must submit an affirmation confirming the opposing party has been given notice of the date, place, and time of the application.

5. **Specificity Required:** The moving party must specify the exact relief sought (a) in the order to show cause, and (b) in a concluding section of the memorandum of law.

### C. Motions to Seal

Applications to file under seal **must** be made by Order to Show Cause. Documents filed in connection with motions to seal remain under temporary seal for 14 days. Absent a timely OSC with a TRO extending the temporary sealing period, the seal lifts on the 14th day.

### D. Remedy When OSC Is Declined

When a court declines to sign an order to show cause, the remedy is an appeal to the Appellate Division pursuant to **CPLR 5704(a)**—not resubmission to a different Supreme Court Justice.

*See* Schlam Stone & Dolan, "Remedy for Motion Court's Refusal to Sign Order to Show Cause is Appeal, Not Re-submission to a Different Judge" (June 15, 2019).

## III. LEGAL STANDARD FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS

New York courts consider the issuance of a preliminary injunction to be an **"extraordinary remedy"** that should not be granted as a routine matter. The movant must satisfy the **tripartite test**:

1. **Likelihood of ultimate success on the merits**
2. **Irreparable injury** if the preliminary injunction is withheld
3. **Balance of equities** tipping in the movant's favor

*See* CPLR 6301; *Nobu Next Door, LLC v. Fine Arts Hous., Inc.*, 4 N.Y.3d 839 (2005).

### Mandatory Injunctions

A **mandatory preliminary injunction** (directing affirmative conduct rather than restraining actions) requires an **even more rigorous standard** and is only granted under "extraordinary circumstances."

### Temporary Restraining Orders

Under CPLR 6313, if on a motion for a preliminary injunction the plaintiff shows immediate and irreparable injury will result unless the defendant is restrained before a hearing can be had, a **TRO may be granted without notice**. Upon granting a TRO, the court must set the preliminary injunction hearing at the earliest possible time.

## IV. CASE DECISIONS — PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS GRANTED

### A. Vision Biobanc Holdings LLC v. Derek R. Taller

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 651706/2024 |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Margaret A. Chan |
| **Date** | October 15, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Preliminary Injunction **GRANTED** |

**Facts:** The company's largest investor and members holding over 70% of membership interests voted to remove defendant Taller from his positions as CEO and Chairperson. Upon learning of his removal, Taller allegedly engaged in disruptive conduct, including attempting to transfer $550,000 from the company's account.

**Holding:** The court found Vision had "a clear right to the relief it seeks" and would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction due to ongoing disruption to company operations. Taller was barred from acting on behalf of the company or transferring any company funds.

**Key Quote:** Taller's actions "prevented Vision from accessing its accounts, impeded its ability to make payments to vendors...and caused chaos."

### B. Cooper Union v. R&S Chrysler LLC

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 158973/2024 |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Date** | November 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Preliminary Injunction **GRANTED** |

**Facts:** Dispute over management and control of commercial property at 405 Lexington Avenue.

**Holding:** The court enjoined R&S Chrysler LLC from:
- Taking steps to interfere with Cooper Union's efforts to collect rent from subtenants
- Serving default or termination notices upon subtenants
- Interfering with Cooper Union's management, operation, and control of the building

**Undertaking:** Cooper Union was required to post a $500,000 undertaking by November 14, 2024.

### C. Viracocha Wind Holdco LLC v. Ignis Energy USA LLC

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 652538/2024 & 652587/2024 (companion cases) |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Andrea Masley |
| **Date** | October 16, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Preliminary Injunction **GRANTED** |

**Facts:** Dispute among participants in a California energy project.

**Holding:** Injunctive relief granted to project participants. Decision entered in both the primary action and companion case.

---

### D. Sebco Dev. v. Bldg. Mgmt. Assocs.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Court** | Bronx County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Fidel E. Gomez |
| **Ruling** | Preliminary Injunction AND Mandatory Injunction **GRANTED** |

**Facts:** Plaintiffs—a not-for-profit housing organization and property owners—terminated the defendant property manager in January 2023. The defendant then improperly denied access to bank accounts, continued drawing fees, and withheld tenant data and property information.

**Holding:** The court found "extraordinary circumstances" warranting both prohibitory and mandatory injunctive relief. Without the injunction allowing management transition, the organization would lose rental subsidies and cease operations—establishing irreparable harm.

**Key Quote:** Defendant had "no right to prevent access to and could not control the plaintiffs' bank accounts or data."

### E. Burt v. Jerez

| | |
|---|---|
| **Court** | Albany County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Richard Platkin |
| **Date** | November 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Preliminary Injunction **GRANTED IN PART** |

**Facts:** Closely-held business owner sought injunction over co-owner's sale of a solar power business.

**Holding:** The court found a preliminary injunction restraining defendant from effectuating further sales or transfers of business assets without consent was necessary to avert irreparable harm. However, the court **declined** to order escrowing of sale proceeds because the sale had already been completed.

---

## V. CASE DECISIONS — PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS DENIED

### A. NAP IV LLC v. Qube USA LLC

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 651937/2024 |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Margaret A. Chan |
| **Date** | May 31, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Preliminary Injunction **DENIED** |

**Facts:** Plaintiff sought to block defendants from opening a cannabis dispensary, claiming the defendants violated a non-disclosure agreement containing a non-circumvention clause. Plaintiff alleged defendants improperly accessed a Times Square location that plaintiff had presented to them.

**Holding:** The court found **no irreparable harm**. The location's address and landlord identity were "not a secret" since multiple parties knew about it, and a public "For Lease" sign advertised the space. Even if trade secret protection applied, preventing the defendants from operating would not shield the information from public knowledge. Plaintiff could pursue monetary damages.

**Key Takeaway:** A party seeking merely monetary relief is generally not entitled to a preliminary injunction.

### B. BR Fund IV Acq Inv, LLC v. Brightwood Capital Fund III

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 651756/2024 |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Margaret A. Chan |
| **Date** | August 20, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Preliminary Injunction **DENIED** |

**Facts:** Two investment funds sought specific performance of a purchase agreement against several affiliated managers and holding companies.

**Holding:** The court concluded that the motion more accurately sought a **mandatory injunction** requiring the case's ultimate relief, which requires a higher standard of proof. Applying that heightened standard, the court denied the motion.

**Key Takeaway:** When a "preliminary injunction" effectively seeks the ultimate relief in the case, courts apply the more rigorous mandatory injunction standard.

## VI. OTHER OSC-RELATED RULINGS

### A. Jaffrey v. Scaminaci (Sealing/Unsealing via OSC)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Index No.** | 653352/2022 |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Andrea Masley |
| **Date** | July 11, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Motion to Unseal **GRANTED** with Directed Redactions |

**Holding:** Justice Masley granted defendant Scaminaci's motion to unseal but directed redactions for documents containing confidential business information.

### B. Gem Holdco, LLC v. Changing World Technologies, L.P. (Civil Contempt via OSC)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2016 NY Slip Op. 31028(U) |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Shirley Werner Kornreich |
| **Date** | June 3, 2016 |
| **Ruling** | Civil Contempt **GRANTED**; Defendant Remanded to Jail |

**Facts:** The CWT Parties moved by Order to Show Cause for contempt, which included a TRO freezing the assets of RDX. Immediately thereafter, defendants Danzik and RDX set up a shell company (M2R Licensing LLC) to divert the receivables of RDX in violation of the TRO.

**Holding:** Justice Kornreich held defendants in civil contempt and gave Danzik one opportunity to purge himself of contempt by returning $5 million in tax credits by June 15, 2016, otherwise he was to be imprisoned with civil and criminal monetary penalties.

---

## VII. TRO UNDERTAKING REQUIREMENTS

### Key Principle

CPLR 6312(b) requires that prior to the granting of a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff shall give an **undertaking** in an amount to be fixed by the court. The purpose of the undertaking is to provide a source of recovery for damages suffered from the pendency of the restraint.

### Relevant Rulings

1. **Undertaking May Be Reduced for Non-Compliance:** A $250,000 undertaking was amended to a nominal $100 when defendants failed to comply with the preliminary injunction. (Commercial Division, 2020)

2. **Undertaking Must Be Maintained:** The First Department held it was error to vacate an undertaking when denying a preliminary injunction and dissolving a TRO. The undertaking should be maintained pending a determination of damages. (First Dep't, 2017)

## X. CONCLUSION

Orders to show cause in the New York County Commercial Division are reserved for genuinely urgent matters requiring provisional relief, stays, or where mandated by statute. Recent case law demonstrates that courts rigorously apply the tripartite test for preliminary injunctions and will deny relief where irreparable harm is not established or where the movant is effectively seeking monetary damages. Practitioners should carefully document urgency, irreparable harm, and the balance of equities when bringing OSC applications.
