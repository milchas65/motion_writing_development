**FROM:**    Research Department
**DATE:**    December 31, 2024
**RE:**      Recent New York State Court Decisions on Expert Discovery Disputes

---

## I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum summarizes recent decisions from New York State courts addressing expert discovery disputes. The cases cover expert disclosure requirements, preclusion for non-compliance, the distinction between Commercial Division rules and general CPLR practice, and special rules for medical malpractice cases.

---

## II. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. First Department

#### 1. Taxi Tours Inc. v. Go N.Y. Tours Inc.
**227 A.D.3d 530 | First Department | May 16, 2024**

In this commercial dispute, the defendant failed to provide the data underlying its expert's opinions as required by Commercial Division Rule 13(c)(B).

**Holding:** The First Department affirmed the trial court's exclusion of the expert's report and testimony.

**Key Rulings:**
- Commercial Division Rule 13(c)(B) requires disclosure of "the data forming the basis for [the] expert's opinion"
- Defendant "should have known about its rule 13(c) obligation to supply that data while submitting the expert disclosure"
- "The absence of the data cannot be considered harmless given the prejudice involved"
- Defendant failed to show that its nondisclosure was "substantially justified"
- Leave to reopen discovery was properly denied

**Significance:** This decision reinforces that Commercial Division courts will strictly enforce Rule 13(c) requirements and that failure to provide underlying data—even if gathered years earlier by a nonparty—will result in preclusion.

---

### B. Second Department

#### 2. New York Bus Operators Compensation Trust v. Network Adjusters, Inc.
**Second Department | 2024**

A party sought to appeal the Supreme Court's determination granting a motion to preclude expert testimony.

**Holding:** The appeal was dismissed.

**Key Ruling:** "Such a ruling, even when made in advance of trial on motion papers, constitutes, at best, an advisory opinion, which is not appealable, either as of right or by permission."

**Significance:** Expert preclusion rulings are evidentiary in nature and are generally not immediately appealable, even when made before trial.

---

### C. Third Department

#### 3. Schultz v. Albany Med. Ctr. Hosp.
**2025 N.Y. Slip Op. 02827 | Third Department | May 8, 2025**

In this medical malpractice and wrongful death action, the plaintiff filed a "response to expert witness" that disclosed only the name and CV of a single expert (a forensic pathologist) but provided no summary of expected testimony and reserved the right to supplement this information.

**Holding:** The expert disclosure was insufficient.

**Key Ruling:** Expert disclosure must include more than just the expert's name and CV; it must provide substantive information about expected testimony as required by CPLR 3101(d).

**Significance:** Demonstrates that even in general (non-Commercial Division) practice, courts expect meaningful expert disclosure, not mere placeholder filings.

---

## III. NEW YORK COUNTY COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 4. Moghtaderi v. Apis Capital Advisors, LLC
**Justice Melissa A. Crane | January 2024**

The plaintiff waited until the eve of trial to provide expert disclosure.

**Holding:** The court granted defendants' motion in limine, precluding plaintiff's expert under Commercial Division Rule 13(c).

**Key Rulings:**
- Rule 13(c) provides that "the note of issue and certificate of readiness may not be filed until the completion of expert disclosure"
- "Expert disclosure provided after these dates without good cause will be precluded"
- The late disclosure was "prejudicial to defendants who have been diligently preparing for a trial without an expert for months"

**Significance:** Reinforces that expert disclosure deadlines in the Commercial Division are strictly enforced, and eve-of-trial disclosures will be precluded absent good cause.

---

#### 5. Expert Reports with Disclosure Gaps Decision
**Justice Nancy M. Bannon | October 2024**

The defendants moved to preclude plaintiff's expert reports, arguing non-compliance with Commercial Division Rule 13(c) and challenging the experts' qualifications.

**Holding:** Motion to preclude denied, but limitations imposed on expert testimony.

**Key Rulings:**
- There is no prohibition against jointly-authored expert reports
- Preclusion of expert testimony for non-compliance with Rule 13(c) is at the court's discretion
- Defendants must show prejudice resulting from disclosure issues
- The court imposed specific limitations on the expert's testimony to preclude opinions on legal conclusions

**Significance:** Demonstrates that courts have discretion to fashion remedies short of outright preclusion, particularly where no prejudice is shown. However, courts will limit expert testimony that encroaches on legal conclusions reserved for the court.

---

## IV. OTHER TRIAL COURT DECISIONS

#### 6. Rivera v. New York City Health & Hospitals Corp.
**2024 NY Slip Op 24106**

In this medical malpractice action, both parties presented expert opinions on the standard of care.

**Holding:** Triable issues of fact existed regarding the radiologist's interpretation.

**Key Ruling:** "When experts offer conflicting opinions, a credibility question is presented requiring a jury's resolution."

**Significance:** Confirms that conflicting expert opinions typically preclude summary judgment and must be resolved by the trier of fact.

---

#### 7. People v. Trump
**March 18, 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 24121**

The court addressed motions regarding whether proposed testimony of a witness should be treated as expert testimony.

**Key Issue:** Whether an expert witness is permitted to offer legal conclusions.

**Significance:** Reinforces the principle that expert witnesses may not offer legal conclusions, which are reserved for the court.

---

## V. CRIMINAL CASES (EXPERT DISCLOSURE)

#### 8. People v. Brebnor
**2024 NY Slip Op 50981(U)**

The People sought to establish compliance with discovery obligations regarding expert witnesses.

**Holding:** The People exercised reasonable diligence.

**Key Ruling:** The People exercised reasonable diligence by sending subpoenas for expert witness CVs. Expert materials must be disclosed no later than sixty days before the first scheduled trial date.

---

#### 9. People v. Williams
**Third Department | 2024**

The defendant challenged the People's certificate of compliance based on belated expert disclosure.

**Holding:** Addressed the timing of expert disclosure relative to the certificate of compliance.

**Key Ruling:** "Although belated disclosure will not necessarily establish a lack of due diligence or render an initial COC improper, post-filing disclosure and a supplemental COC cannot compensate for a failure to exercise diligence before the initial COC is filed."

---

#### 10. People v. Goldman
**2024 NY Slip Op 50537(U)**

This case addressed requirements for expert witness disclosure in criminal proceedings.

**Key Ruling:** Expert disclosure must include "a written statement of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion."

---

## VI. EXPERT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS COMPARISON

### A. Commercial Division Rule 13(c) Requirements

Under Commercial Division Rule 13(c), expert disclosure must be accompanied by a written report, prepared and signed by the witness, which must include:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **(A) Complete Statement of Opinions** | All opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them |
| **(B) Underlying Data** | The data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinion(s) |
| **(C) Exhibits** | Any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support the opinion(s) |
| **(D) Qualifications** | The witness's qualifications, including a list of all publications authored in the previous 10 years |
| **(E) Prior Testimony** | A list of all other cases at which the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition during the previous four years |
| **(F) Compensation** | A statement of the compensation to be paid to the witness for the study and testimony in the case |

### B. CPLR 3101(d) Requirements (General Courts)

In courts outside the Commercial Division, CPLR 3101(d) requires only:

- Subject matter on which each expert is expected to testify
- Substance of the facts and opinions on which each expert is expected to testify
- Qualifications of each expert witness
- Summary of the grounds for each expert's opinion

**Key Differences:**
- No written report required under CPLR 3101(d)
- No requirement to disclose underlying data
- No requirement to list prior testimony or compensation
- Expert depositions generally not permitted (absent special circumstances)

### C. Timing Requirements

| Court | Timing Rule |
|-------|-------------|
| **Commercial Division** | Expert disclosure must be completed within 4 months after fact discovery closes; note of issue cannot be filed until expert disclosure is complete |
| **General Courts** | No universal rule requiring disclosure before note of issue; no rule requiring disclosure a certain time before trial |
| **Criminal Cases** | Expert materials must be disclosed no later than 60 days before first scheduled trial date |

---

## VII. MEDICAL MALPRACTICE SPECIAL RULES

### A. Expert Name Anonymity

In medical, dental, or podiatric malpractice actions, a party may omit the names of medical, dental, or podiatric experts but must make all other disclosures required by CPLR 3101(d)(1)(i).

### B. Expert Deposition Exchange Procedure

CPLR 3101(d)(1)(ii) provides a unique procedure for expert depositions in medical malpractice cases:

1. **Written Offer:** Any party may serve a written offer to disclose expert names and make them available for deposition
2. **20-Day Response:** Other parties must accept or reject within 20 days; failure to respond = rejection
3. **Mutual Obligation:** If all parties accept, each party must produce their expert for deposition
4. **Preclusion Penalty:** If a party who made or accepted the offer fails to produce their expert, that party is precluded from offering expert testimony at trial

### C. Special Circumstances for Additional Discovery

Under CPLR 3101(d)(1)(iii), further disclosure concerning expert testimony (including depositions) may be obtained only by court order upon a showing of "special circumstances."

**What Constitutes Special Circumstances:**
- Physical evidence is lost or destroyed
- Unique factual situation exists
- Information cannot be obtained from other sources
- Expert's methodology is novel or unclear
- Expert played a central factual role in the case

## VIII. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Rule 13(c) Is Strictly Enforced:** Commercial Division courts will preclude expert testimony for failure to comply with Rule 13(c), particularly the requirement to provide underlying data (Taxi Tours v. Go NY Tours).

2. **Good Cause Required for Late Disclosure:** Expert disclosure provided after deadlines will be precluded unless the disclosing party establishes good cause (Moghtaderi v. Apis Capital).

3. **Prejudice Matters for Discretionary Preclusion:** While preclusion is discretionary, courts consider whether the opposing party has been prejudiced by disclosure deficiencies (Justice Bannon Decision).

4. **Jointly-Authored Reports Are Permitted:** There is no prohibition against expert reports authored by multiple experts (Justice Bannon Decision).

5. **Experts Cannot Offer Legal Conclusions:** Courts will limit expert testimony that encroaches on legal conclusions reserved for the court (People v. Trump; Justice Bannon Decision).

6. **Conflicting Experts Preclude Summary Judgment:** When experts offer conflicting opinions, a credibility question is presented requiring jury resolution (Rivera v. NYC Health & Hospitals).

7. **Expert Preclusion Rulings Are Not Immediately Appealable:** Such rulings are evidentiary and constitute advisory opinions that are not appealable as of right or by permission (NY Bus Operators v. Network Adjusters).

8. **Commercial Division Rules Differ Significantly from CPLR:** Practitioners must understand that Commercial Division Rule 13(c) imposes federal-style disclosure requirements not present in general New York practice.

9. **Know Your Deadlines:** In the Commercial Division, expert disclosure must be completed before the note of issue is filed and within four months after fact discovery closes.

10. **Medical Malpractice Has Unique Rules:** The expert deposition exchange procedure under CPLR 3101(d)(1)(ii) creates mutual obligations and preclusion penalties not present in other civil actions.

## IX. PRACTITIONER GUIDANCE

### Commercial Division Practice

- Familiarize yourself with Rule 13(c) before exchanging any expert disclosure
- Ensure expert reports contain all required elements, particularly underlying data
- Meet deadlines strictly; eve-of-trial disclosures will likely be precluded
- Consider whether jointly-authored reports are appropriate for your case
- Be prepared to show good cause for any late disclosure

### General Court Practice

- CPLR 3101(d) disclosure requirements are less stringent but must still be meaningful
- Expert depositions require court order and showing of special circumstances
- Timing of disclosure is more flexible but should be addressed in scheduling orders
- Medical malpractice cases have unique expert exchange procedures

### Criminal Practice

- Expert materials must be disclosed at least 60 days before trial
- Certificates of compliance must reflect diligent pre-filing efforts
- Post-filing supplemental disclosure cannot cure pre-filing lack of diligence
