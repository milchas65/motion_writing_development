**RE:** New York State Court Decisions — Applications for Letters Rogatory

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum summarizes publicly available New York state court decisions concerning applications for letters rogatory and commissions under CPLR 3108. Letters rogatory are formal requests from a court in one jurisdiction to a court in another jurisdiction for judicial assistance, typically to obtain testimony or documents from witnesses located abroad. This memorandum covers the statutory framework, legal standards, recent case decisions, and procedural requirements.

---

## II. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

### A. CPLR 3108 — Written Questions; When Permitted

CPLR 3108 provides:

> "A deposition may be taken on written questions when the examining party and the deponent so stipulate or when the testimony is to be taken without the state. **A commission or letters rogatory may be issued where necessary or convenient for the taking of a deposition outside of the state.**"

The statute is notably brief, and "the details of their procedure are not set forth by statute and, therefore, find their few guidelines in case law and in the court's discretion." *Wiseman v. American Motors Sales Corp.*, 103 A.D.2d 230, 233 (2d Dep't 1984).

### B. CPLR 3102(e) — Incoming Requests

In response to a commission, letters rogatory, or order from another state, a deposition may be taken of a witness in New York, or documents produced from such a witness, and an order of the New York court may be obtained to ensure compliance.

### C. CPLR 3113 — Who May Take Depositions in Foreign Countries

In a foreign country, depositions may be taken before:

1. Any diplomatic or consular agent or representative of the United States, appointed or accredited to, and residing within, the country;
2. A person appointed by commission or under letters rogatory; or
3. An officer of the armed forces authorized to take the acknowledgment of deeds.

Officers may be designated in notices or commissions either by name or descriptive title, and letters rogatory may be addressed "To the Appropriate Authority in (here name the state or country)."

### D. CPLR 3119 — Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (UIDDA)

New York adopted the UIDDA in 2011 as CPLR 3119. The UIDDA provides a streamlined procedure for obtaining discovery from other U.S. states that have also adopted the Act. However, CPLR 3119 only provides a mechanism for disclosure **in New York** for use in an action pending in another state—not the reverse. For obtaining discovery from witnesses in states that have not adopted the UIDDA, or from foreign countries, practitioners must still use the commission or letters rogatory procedures under CPLR 3108.

---

## III. COMMISSION VS. LETTERS ROGATORY

### A. Definitions

| Device | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Commission** | A direction by a New York court to an appointed commissioner under New York law, who bears the seal of the court, to take testimony. An "open commission" proceeds by oral questions; a "sealed commission" utilizes written questions. |
| **Letters Rogatory** | A formal request from a New York court to a foreign court, asking that court to make available its machinery to take the deposition of a person found in that foreign jurisdiction, under the laws of that jurisdiction. |

### B. Key Differences

| Feature | Commission | Letters Rogatory |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Legal Authority** | NY court directs commissioner under NY law | Request to foreign court to use its own procedures |
| **Court Seal** | Bears seal of NY court | No NY seal; foreign court's authority governs |
| **Applicable Rules** | NY procedural rules apply | Foreign jurisdiction's procedures apply |
| **Typical Use** | Out-of-state (domestic) depositions | Foreign country depositions |
| **Form** | Open (oral) or Sealed (written) | Addressed "To the Appropriate Authority in [country]" |

### C. When Each Device Is Used

- **Commission:** Generally used when the witness is in another U.S. state (particularly states that have not adopted the UIDDA) or when the foreign country will recognize and enforce a NY commission.
- **Letters Rogatory:** Generally used when the witness is in a foreign country that requires a formal request through its own judicial system, or when the Hague Evidence Convention procedures apply.

---

## IV. LEGAL STANDARDS

### A. General Standard — "Necessary or Convenient"

Under CPLR 3108, a commission or letters rogatory may be issued where "necessary or convenient" for the taking of a deposition outside the state.

### B. Two-Part Test for Commissions

New York courts will not issue commissions under CPLR 3108 merely upon request. The party seeking the commission must meet a **two-part test**:

1. **Material and Necessary:** The party must demonstrate the information sought is material and necessary to the prosecution or defense of the claims.

2. **Voluntary Compliance Unlikely:** The party must demonstrate that a voluntary appearance or compliance by the witness is unlikely, or that discovery cannot be obtained by stipulation or the cooperation of the witness either in New York or the other state.

*See Vasomedical, Inc. v. Barron*, 2014 NY Slip Op. 51015(U) (Nassau County Commercial Division).

### C. Heightened Standard for International Discovery

For requests involving **international discovery** through letters rogatory, courts apply a heightened standard. The movant must establish that the sought information is **"crucial to the resolution of a key issue"** in the case—not merely "material and necessary."

Courts consider:
- The **importance** of the information sought to the litigation
- The **degree of specificity** of the request
- The **availability of alternative means** of securing the information
- The **effects on U.S. or foreign interests**

*See Bagatelle Little W. 12th LLC v. JEC II, LLC*, 2024 NY Slip Op. 50453(U) (NY County Commercial Division).

### D. Liberal Construction for Nonparty Witnesses

Courts recognize that requests to utilize discovery tools such as letters rogatory should be **liberally granted**. "The mere showing by an attorney that a nonparty witness's pretrial deposition is required to prepare fully for trial suffices as a 'special circumstance' for purposes of applying the liberal discovery policy."

*See Cavaretta v. George*, 270 A.D.2d 862 (4th Dep't 2000).

### E. Subpoena Limitations

There is **no authority for the service of a subpoena on a nonparty witness who is a non-resident of New York State**. Since service of a subpoena outside New York is ineffective to compel a witness to appear at an examination, CPLR 3108 makes available the commission and letter rogatory as devices to secure disclosure.

*See Wiseman v. American Motors Sales Corp.*, 103 A.D.2d 230 (2d Dep't 1984).

## V. CASE DECISIONS — LETTERS ROGATORY/COMMISSION DENIED

### A. Bagatelle Little W. 12th LLC v. JEC II, LLC

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2024 NY Slip Op. 50453(U) |
| **Court** | NY County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Robert R. Reed |
| **Date** | April 19, 2024 |
| **Ruling** | Letters Rogatory **DENIED** |

**Facts:** This action involves a dispute over a restaurant joint venture. Defendants/counterclaimants moved pursuant to CPLR 3102 and 3108 for the issuance of letters rogatory to the appropriate authority in France to compel the production of documents from nonparty company, NextStage. Defendants asserted the documents were material and necessary because they would provide information about NextStage's investment in the Bagatelle family of companies and would establish the purported role that investment played in the alleged improper transfer of funds.

**Holding:** The court refused to issue letters rogatory because the evidence sought was not **crucial** to resolving a key issue in the case.

**Key Reasoning:**
- "Defendants submit that it is necessary and convenient to issue a letter rogatory. **Convenience is not the standard.**"
- Defendants failed to show how their requests differed from what they could have requested from counterclaim defendants directly
- Defendants had not pointed to any deficiencies in production already obtained
- Defendants had not established how information regarding a third-party international investment was crucial to the resolution of a key issue—namely, improper transfers between counterclaim defendant entities

### B. Vasomedical, Inc. v. Barron

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2014 NY Slip Op. 51015(U) |
| **Court** | Nassau County Commercial Division |
| **Justice** | Destefano |
| **Date** | June 30, 2014 |
| **Ruling** | Commission **DENIED** |

**Facts:** Defendants sought commissions to take depositions outside New York from various nonparty witnesses.

**Holding:** The court denied most motions because the application lacked "any information concerning counsel's efforts...to obtain the cooperation and voluntary appearance of the non-party witnesses."

**Key Reasoning:**
- Pursuant to CPLR 3108, a party may take an oral deposition outside the state under an open commission where it is demonstrated to be necessary or convenient
- The party seeking an open commission must demonstrate not only that the information sought is necessary to the investigation of the claim but also that **a voluntary appearance or compliance by the witness is unlikely**
- Absent any showing that the proposed out-of-state deponent would not cooperate with a notice of deposition or would not voluntarily come within New York, the moving party fails to demonstrate that a commission is necessary or convenient

---

### C. People v. DePalo

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trial Court** | NY Supreme Court |
| **Justice** | Zweibel |
| **Trial Date** | August 15, 2016 |
| **Appellate Citation** | 147 AD3d 633 (1st Dep't 2017) |
| **Ruling** | Letters Rogatory **DENIED**; Appeal Dismissed |

**Facts:** This criminal case involved charges that defendant DePalo stole millions of dollars from investors in ArgentUK. Defendants moved for the issuance of Letters Rogatory, asking the court to request an order from a court in the United Kingdom to have 27 witnesses interrogated under British court supervision.

**Trial Court Holding:** Justice Zweibel denied the motion on August 15, 2016.

**Appellate Holding:** The First Department dismissed the appeal on February 23, 2017, ruling that no appeal could be taken from an order entered during the course of a criminal case.

**Key Ruling:** The court found that in New York, **Letters Rogatory are provided for only in the CPLR**, with no mention in the CPL (Criminal Procedure Law). Letters rogatory are **not available in criminal cases** in New York.

## VI. CASE DECISIONS — LETTERS ROGATORY/COMMISSION GRANTED

### A. Boatswain v. Boatswain

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 2004 NY Slip Op 24096 |
| **Court** | NY Supreme Court, Kings County |
| **Date** | 2004 |
| **Ruling** | Open Commission **GRANTED** |

**Facts:** Defendant argued that deposing a foreign witness was not material or necessary to the action because the testimony sought was not sufficiently related to the issues.

**Holding:** Since the nonparty witness resided in a foreign jurisdiction located more than 100 miles from the court, and her testimony was found to be **"relevant, material and necessary"** to the prosecution of the action, the plaintiff's motion for deposition was granted. The court directed the parties to proceed by **open commission** for the deposition.

**Key Principles Established:**
- The issuance of a letter rogatory is simply a letter requesting a foreign jurisdiction to make available the machinery to take the deposition of a person found in that foreign jurisdiction, under the laws of that particular jurisdiction
- This disclosure device foresees the use of the foreign court's foreign procedures
- A commission, by contrast, is direction by a New York court to an appointed commissioner under New York law who bears the seal of this court to take testimony

## VII. SEMINAL AUTHORITIES

### A. Wiseman v. American Motors Sales Corp.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 103 A.D.2d 230 (2d Dep't 1984) |
| **Court** | Second Department |
| **Significance** | Leading authority on CPLR 3108 |

**Key Holdings:**
- Letters rogatory are a "device used for extrastate disclosure, usually in a foreign country"
- The commission is "generally used to secure disclosure from someone outside the State"
- Both are briefly mentioned in CPLR 3108, and "the details of their procedure are not set forth by statute and, therefore, find their few guidelines in case law and in the court's discretion"
- There is **no authority for the service of a subpoena on a nonparty witness who is a non-resident of New York State** (citing Judiciary Law 2-b)
- Since service of a subpoena outside New York is ineffective to compel a witness to appear, CPLR 3108 makes available the commission and letter rogatory as devices to secure disclosure

---

### B. Cavaretta v. George

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | 270 A.D.2d 862 (4th Dep't 2000) |
| **Court** | Fourth Department |
| **Significance** | Liberal standard for letters rogatory |

**Key Holdings:**
- Requests to utilize discovery tools such as letters rogatory should be **liberally granted**
- "The mere showing by an attorney that a nonparty witness's pretrial deposition is required to prepare fully for trial suffices as a 'special circumstance'" for applying the liberal discovery policy
- Where witnesses outside New York "may have evidence 'material and necessary' in the defense of the action," parties are entitled to receive a court order issuing letters rogatory requesting the assistance of a foreign court

---

## VIII. INCOMING LETTERS ROGATORY — REQUESTS TO NEW YORK COURTS

### A. State Court Practice (CPLR 3102(e))

In response to a commission, letters rogatory, or order from another state, a deposition may be taken of a witness in New York, or documents produced from such a witness, and an order of the New York court may be obtained to ensure compliance.

**Requirements:**
- The application must be made by an attorney admitted to practice in New York who has a New York address

### B. Federal Court Practice (28 USC 1782)

For federal courts in New York, incoming requests for discovery in aid of foreign proceedings are largely handled under **28 USC 1782**, which has substantially replaced letters rogatory for most purposes.

**Three Requirements:**
1. The target of the discovery request "resides or is found" in the district where the court sits
2. The discovery requested is "for use in a proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal"
3. The request is made by a foreign or international tribunal or upon the application of any interested person

**Discretionary Factors (Intel factors):**
Once the three prerequisites are satisfied, the decision to order discovery is left to the court's discretion, informed by factors set out by the Supreme Court in *Intel Corp. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.*, 542 U.S. 241 (2004).

### C. Notable Incoming Request Case

**SEC v. Terraform Labs Pte Ltd (2023)**

By letter dated September 25, 2023, U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Southern District of New York issued a request under The Hague Convention of 18 March 1970 on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters for documentary evidence from MEK Global Ltd. (KuCoin), an international business company incorporated in Seychelles.

---

## IX. HAGUE EVIDENCE CONVENTION

### A. Overview

The Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters (1970) provides an alternative framework for obtaining evidence from witnesses in signatory countries. New York courts have recognized that letters rogatory under the Hague Evidence Convention are an appropriate means to compel testimony or document production from nonparties abroad.

### B. Letters Rogatory vs. Hague Letters

| Feature | Letters Rogatory | Hague Convention Letters |
|---------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Transmission** | Through U.S. Department of State (diplomatic channels) | Directly to the foreign Central Authority |
| **Timeline** | Can take a year or more | Generally faster than traditional letters rogatory |
| **Applicability** | Any country | Only Hague Convention signatory countries |

### C. When to Use Each Method

- **Hague Convention:** When seeking discovery in countries that are signatories to the Convention
- **Traditional Letters Rogatory:** When seeking discovery in non-signatory countries; must be submitted through the U.S. Department of State via diplomatic channels

---

## X. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS (NEW YORK COUNTY)

### A. Ex Parte Office Procedures

Per the NY Courts website for New York County:

- Letters rogatory are granted on **motion or stipulation**
- If the request is granted, an order is initialed by the court and the letter is signed with a **full signature**
- There is **no prescribed form** for a letter rogatory
- Letters rogatory may be addressed "To the Appropriate Authority in (here name the state or country)"

### B. Application Requirements

- The application must be made by an **attorney admitted to practice in New York** who has a New York address
- Proposed orders should be submitted with the motion when appropriate

### C. Timeline Considerations

Practitioners should assume that the letters rogatory process will take **a year or more** when transmitted through diplomatic channels. The time involved may be shortened by transmitting a copy of the request through Interpol (in criminal matters) or by using Hague Convention procedures where available.

---

## XI. PRACTICE POINTERS

### A. Before Seeking Letters Rogatory or Commission:

1. **Attempt Voluntary Cooperation First:** Document efforts to obtain voluntary cooperation from the witness. Courts will deny applications where no showing is made that the witness would refuse to cooperate.

2. **Establish Materiality:** Demonstrate that the information sought is material and necessary—and for international discovery, **crucial**—to the prosecution or defense of the action.

3. **Consider Alternatives:** Show that the information cannot be obtained through other means, such as from party witnesses or through document requests to parties.

4. **Be Specific:** Avoid broad, fishing-expedition requests. Specify exactly what testimony or documents are needed and why.

5. **Know the Foreign Jurisdiction:** Understand whether the target country is a Hague Convention signatory and what procedures that country requires.

### B. Drafting the Application:

1. **Identify the Witness:** Provide full name and address of the witness to be deposed or from whom documents are sought.

2. **State the Issues:** Clearly identify the issues in the case and explain how the witness's testimony or documents relate to those issues.

3. **Explain Why Crucial:** For international discovery, explain why the evidence is crucial to resolving a key issue in the case.

4. **Document Non-Cooperation:** If voluntary cooperation was attempted and refused, document this in the application.

5. **Propose the Form:** Indicate whether an open commission (oral questions) or letters rogatory is appropriate based on the circumstances.

---

## XII. SUMMARY OF STANDARDS

| Type of Request | Standard | Key Requirements |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| **Domestic Commission (CPLR 3108)** | "Necessary or convenient" | (1) Material and necessary; (2) Voluntary compliance unlikely |
| **International Letters Rogatory** | "Crucial to key issue" | Heightened standard; must show crucial to resolution of key issue |
| **Nonparty Witness** | Liberal standard | Mere showing that deposition required to prepare for trial suffices |
| **Criminal Cases** | Not available | Letters rogatory not authorized under CPL |

---

## XIV. CONCLUSION

Applications for letters rogatory and commissions in New York courts are governed by CPLR 3108 and require a showing that the discovery is "necessary or convenient." For domestic out-of-state discovery, courts require proof that voluntary compliance is unlikely. For international discovery, courts apply a heightened standard requiring the movant to demonstrate the evidence is "crucial to the resolution of a key issue" in the case. Letters rogatory are not available in criminal proceedings in New York. Practitioners should document attempts at voluntary cooperation, establish the materiality and necessity of the discovery sought, and be prepared to explain why the evidence cannot be obtained through alternative means.
