## II. APPELLATE DIVISION DECISIONS

### A. Second Department

#### 1. Lurie v. Lurie
**226 A.D.3d 992 | Second Department | 2024**

In an action for a judgment declaring that the plaintiff is the sole owner and stockholder of a corporation, to impose a constructive trust, and to recover damages for breach of fiduciary duty, the defendants appealed from an order concerning interrogatories.

**Issue:** Whether the plaintiffs demonstrated "good cause" for interrogatories beyond the standard categories permitted under Commercial Division Rule 11-a(c).

**Holdings:**
- The plaintiffs demonstrated "good cause" for an interrogatory seeking information identifying any gifts, transfers, devises, and/or bequests made by Abraham Lurie to certain family members in 2012
- However, the interrogatory seeking the same information from January 1, 1998 through the present was "overly broad and unduly burdensome"
- Any response to the broader interrogatory "would not be relevant to the issue of donative intent with respect to the ownership of LMC, except as to any gifts, transfers, devises, and/or bequests made by Abraham Lurie to those family members in 2012"

**Significance:** This decision clarifies the "good cause" standard under Commercial Division Rule 11-a(c), demonstrating that courts will permit interrogatories beyond the standard categories where relevant to specific claims, but will limit overbroad requests that exceed the scope of the allegations in the complaint.

#### 2. Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Evanson
**Second Department | September 11, 2024**

In a mortgage foreclosure action, the defendant served discovery demands on the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to respond. Three months later, the defendant again served the demands with a letter threatening to move to strike the lender's complaint if responses were not served within ninety days.

The defendant then moved to strike the lender's complaint pursuant to CPLR 3126(3) because of the lender's failure to respond to the discovery demands.

**Holding:** The motion court denied the motion.

**Key Rulings:**
- The defendant failed to comply with 22 NYCRR 202.7 and 202.20-f(b)
- There was no indication that the defendant's counsel made any effort to confer with the lender's counsel to resolve the discovery dispute
- The defendant did not first move to compel disclosure under CPLR 3124
- "The defendant's showing on the motion was wholly inadequate to warrant the extreme discovery sanction of striking the complaint"

**Procedural Requirements:**
- Absent "exigent circumstances," counsel must confer and make a good faith effort to resolve discovery disputes before seeking court involvement
- Any discovery motion must be accompanied by an affirmation of good faith containing required specifics as to the steps taken to resolve the dispute
- A party should generally move to compel under CPLR 3124 before seeking the drastic remedy of striking a pleading under CPLR 3126

---

#### 3. Matter of Liebowitz
**Second Department | 2024**

This attorney disciplinary matter involved false interrogatory responses.

**Findings:**
- The verification of interrogatory responses was "false and misleading"
- The respondent "knew that it was false and misleading when it was served"
- The plaintiff did not see the interrogatory responses and verification before these documents were served

**Significance:** Attorneys may face disciplinary consequences for serving false or misleading interrogatory verifications, even when clients do not review the responses before service.

---

### B. First Department

#### 4. Adler Windows, Inc. v. Freidheim
**First Department | 2024**

In a breach of contract action, the plaintiff asserted claims for quantum meruit and unjust enrichment.

**Holding:** The Supreme Court properly dismissed plaintiff's remaining claims.

**Key Ruling:** The plaintiff "never produced evidence during discovery quantifying its actual job costs to support the quantum meruit cause of action in response to defendant's discovery demands."

**Significance:** Failure to provide substantive responses to interrogatories and discovery demands can result in dismissal of claims that depend on the requested information.

---

#### 5. Structure Tone Global Services, Inc.
**First Department | 2024-2025**

A Supreme Court order granted plaintiffs' CPLR 3126 motion for sanctions, striking defendant's answer for discovery violations including failure to respond to discovery demands.

**Holding:** The Appellate Division modified the order, reinstating the answer subject to conditions.

**Key Rulings:**
- Plaintiffs did not dispute that defendant "substantially complied with discovery requirements through the several years of litigation until the dispute underlying this appeal"
- "Even where the proffered excuse is less than compelling, there is a strong preference in our law that matters be decided on their merits"
- Courts should consider lesser sanctions before striking pleadings

---

## III. COMMERCIAL DIVISION DECISIONS

#### 6. Tsung Tsin Association, Inc. v. Tian Xiang Zhu
**Justice Jennifer G. Schecter | 2024**

The defendant and his counsel "ignored and violated virtually every one of the court's discovery directives," including failing to serve supplemental responses and produce responsive documents.

**Holding:** The court issued a conditional order requiring complete compliance with discovery obligations.

**Key Ruling:** "Given Zhu's history of disregarding court orders, anything short of complete compliance with this order will result in the striking of his pleadings."

**Significance:** Repeated failure to comply with interrogatory and discovery obligations, even after court warnings, will result in case-dispositive sanctions.

---

## IV. OTHER TRIAL COURT DECISIONS

#### 7. J.F. v. 110 Grill
**February 2024 | 2024 NY Slip Op 24038**

In a civil action, the defendant sought to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination to preclude all discovery, including interrogatories.

**Holding:** Paper discovery and depositions must proceed.

**Key Rulings:**
- "Invoking the privilege against self-incrimination is generally an insufficient basis for precluding discovery in a civil matter"
- The defendant may invoke the right against self-incrimination when answering specific interrogatories, but cannot use it to block all discovery
- The privilege must be asserted on a question-by-question basis; blanket refusals are not permitted

**Significance:** Parties cannot use Fifth Amendment privilege to avoid all interrogatory obligations in civil cases; they must respond to each interrogatory and invoke the privilege specifically where applicable.

---

## V. INTERROGATORY RULES FRAMEWORK

### A. CPLR Statutory Framework

#### CPLR 3130 - Use of Interrogatories

| Provision | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Authorization** | After commencement of action, any party may serve written interrogatories on any other party |
| **Bill of Particulars Limitation** | Except in matrimonial actions, a party may not serve interrogatories AND demand a bill of particulars from the same party |

#### CPLR 3131 - Scope of Interrogatories

- Interrogatories may relate to any matters embraced in the disclosure requirement of CPLR 3101
- Answers may be used to the same extent as depositions of a party
- Interrogatories may require copies of papers, documents, or photographs relevant to the answers

#### CPLR 3132 - Service of Interrogatories

- May be served after commencement of action
- May not be served on defendant before time for responsive pleading has expired (without leave of court)

#### CPLR 3133 - Service of Answers or Objections

| Requirement | Rule |
|-------------|------|
| **Response Deadline** | 20 days after service of interrogatories |
| **Objections** | Reasons shall be stated with "reasonable particularity" |
| **Amendment** | Answers may be amended or supplemented only by court order upon motion |
| **Verification** | Answers must be verified by the party responding |

### B. Commercial Division Rule 11-a

#### Number and Scope Limitations

| Limitation | Rule |
|------------|------|
| **Maximum Number** | 25 interrogatories (including subparts) |
| **Permitted Scope** | (1) Names of witnesses with material knowledge; (2) Computation of each category of damages; (3) Existence, custodian, location, and description of material documents |

---

## VI. STANDARDS FOR INTERROGATORY RESPONSES

### A. Sufficiency Requirements

**Blessin v. Greenberg** (Second Department) established key standards:

| Deficiency | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Conclusory Answers** | Overly general or conclusory answers do not comply with disclosure requirements |
| **Nonresponsive Answers** | Answers that fail to address the question asked are insufficient |
| **Lack of Detail** | Responses that fail to provide a "reasonable level of detail" are deficient |
| **Reserved Answers** | Responses that "improperly reserved the right to provide answers at a later time" are improper |

### B. Objection Requirements

Under CPLR 3133(b), objections must:
- Be stated with "reasonable particularity"
- Provide detailed legal grounds (relevance, privilege, undue burden)
- Avoid generalized refusals (e.g., "overbroad" without explanation)

**Best Practice:** State all applicable objections in initial response; answer interrogatories even when accompanied by objections to prevent motions to compel.

---

## VII. FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE IN INTERROGATORIES

### A. General Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Right to Assert** | Parties may invoke Fifth Amendment in civil interrogatories |
| **Question-by-Question** | Must assert privilege for each specific interrogatory; blanket refusals not permitted |
| **Adverse Inference** | Court or jury may draw adverse inference against party who refuses to answer |
| **Waiver** | Failure to timely raise privilege waives the protection |
| **Burden** | Witness must justify silence; must show reasonable cause to fear self-incrimination |

### B. Key Authority

**McDermott v. Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hosp.**, 15 NY2d 20, 28 (1964):
- "Unlike his counterpart in a criminal prosecution, the defendant in a civil suit has no inherent right to remain silent"
- A party "must, if called as a witness, respond to virtually all questions aimed at eliciting information he may possess relevant to the issues"

### C. 2024 Application

**J.F. v. 110 Grill** (2024) confirmed:
- Self-incrimination privilege is "generally an insufficient basis for precluding discovery in a civil matter"
- Parties must respond to interrogatories and invoke privilege specifically where applicable
- Complete blockage of discovery based on Fifth Amendment is not permitted

---

## VIII. PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERROGATORY DISPUTES

### A. Good Faith Conferral (22 NYCRR 202.7, 202.20-f)

**Requirement:** Before seeking court involvement in discovery disputes, counsel must:
1. Confer with opposing counsel in good faith
2. Attempt to resolve the dispute informally
3. If motion is necessary, include affirmation of good faith detailing:
   - Time, place, and nature of consultation
   - Issues discussed
   - Any resolutions reached
   - Or good cause why conferral was not held

**Consequence of Non-Compliance:** Motion may be denied (*Bayview Loan Servicing v. Evanson*).

### B. Motion to Compel (CPLR 3124)

- Available when a party "fails to respond to or comply with any request, notice, interrogatory, demand, question or order"
- Should generally be pursued before seeking sanctions under CPLR 3126
- Must be accompanied by good faith affirmation

### C. Sanctions (CPLR 3126)

Available sanctions for interrogatory violations:

| Sanction | CPLR Section |
|----------|--------------|
| **Issue Preclusion** | 3126(1) - Facts may be deemed established |
| **Evidence Preclusion** | 3126(2) - Party may be prohibited from introducing evidence |
| **Striking Pleadings** | 3126(3) - Complaint or answer may be struck |
| **Default Judgment** | 3126(3) - Judgment may be rendered |

**Standard:** Striking pleadings requires "clear showing that the failure to comply with discovery demands or court-ordered discovery is willful and contumacious."

---

## IX. TYPES OF INTERROGATORY DISPUTES

| Issue | Key Cases | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Scope / Good Cause** | Lurie v. Lurie | Limited to allegations in complaint |
| **Failure to Respond** | Bayview Loan Servicing v. Evanson | Motion denied; must confer first |
| **Insufficient Responses** | Blessin v. Greenberg | Conclusory answers insufficient |
| **False Verification** | Matter of Liebowitz | Disciplinary consequences |
| **Fifth Amendment** | J.F. v. 110 Grill | Must invoke question-by-question |
| **Repeated Non-Compliance** | Tsung Tsin v. Zhu | Conditional order; pleading struck |
| **Failure to Produce Evidence** | Adler Windows v. Freidheim | Claims dismissed |

---

## X. KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Good Cause Required for Expanded Scope:** In the Commercial Division, interrogatories beyond the standard categories (witnesses, damages, documents) require "good cause" and must be tailored to the specific allegations in the complaint (*Lurie v. Lurie*).

2. **Confer Before Filing:** Failure to confer in good faith before seeking court intervention will result in denial of the motion (*Bayview Loan Servicing v. Evanson*).

3. **Move to Compel First:** Generally, a party should move to compel under CPLR 3124 before seeking the drastic remedy of striking pleadings under CPLR 3126.

4. **Responses Must Be Substantive:** Conclusory, nonresponsive, or reserved answers are insufficient and may result in sanctions (*Blessin v. Greenberg*).

5. **Objections Require Particularity:** Generalized objections without specific legal grounds are insufficient under CPLR 3133(b).

6. **Fifth Amendment Limits:** Self-incrimination privilege must be invoked question-by-question; blanket refusals are not permitted in civil cases (*J.F. v. 110 Grill*).

7. **False Verifications Have Consequences:** Attorneys may face discipline for serving false or misleading interrogatory verifications (*Matter of Liebowitz*).

8. **Contention Interrogatories Come Last:** In the Commercial Division, contention interrogatories may only be served at the conclusion of other discovery, at least 30 days before the discovery cut-off.

9. **25 Interrogatory Limit:** The Commercial Division limits interrogatories to 25 (including subparts) unless otherwise agreed or ordered.

10. **Preference for Merits Resolution:** Courts have a "strong preference" for resolving matters on the merits and will consider lesser sanctions before striking pleadings (*Structure Tone*).
