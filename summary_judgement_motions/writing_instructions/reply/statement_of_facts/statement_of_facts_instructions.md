# Statement of Facts Instructions (Summary Judgment Reply)

## Note
Reply briefs typically do not include a new Statement of Facts. Facts were established in the opening brief.

## When to Address Facts
- Opponent submitted new affidavits requiring response
- Opponent materially misstated facts
- Need to respond to opponent's counter-statement

## How to Address

### Responding to New Evidence
> Plaintiff submits for the first time an affidavit from [witness]. This affidavit [contradicts prior testimony / lacks foundation / does not create a genuine dispute because...].

### Correcting Misstatements
> Plaintiff mischaracterizes the record. [Correct statement with citation.]

### Responding to Counter-Statement
If local rules require, file a response to opponent's additional facts:
```
RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF'S ADDITIONAL MATERIAL FACTS

50. DISPUTED. [Contrary evidence.] (Citation.)
51. ADMITTED in part. [Qualification.] (Citation.)
```

## Placement
Address factual issues within the Argument section rather than in a separate statement.
