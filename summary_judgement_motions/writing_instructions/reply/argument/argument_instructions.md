## Rebuttal Techniques

### Conclusory vs. Evidentiary
> Plaintiff's assertion that [claim] is conclusory and unsupported by evidence. "[M]ere conclusions, expressions of hope or unsubstantiated allegations or assertions are insufficient" to defeat summary judgment. *Zuckerman*, 49 N.Y.2d at 562.

### Sham Affidavit
> Plaintiff's opposition affidavit contradicts her deposition testimony and should be disregarded. A party cannot create a factual dispute by submitting an affidavit that contradicts prior sworn testimony.

### Immaterial Disputes
> Even accepting Plaintiff's version of [disputed fact], summary judgment is still warranted. This dispute is immaterial because [explanation].

### Documentary Evidence Controls
> Plaintiff's self-serving assertions cannot overcome the clear documentary evidence showing [fact]. The signed Agreement states [quote]. Plaintiff's after-the-fact characterization does not create a genuine dispute.

### No Evidence Cited
> Plaintiff claims [assertion] but cites no evidence in support. Unsupported assertions are insufficient to defeat summary judgment.

## Distinguishing Cases
> Plaintiff's reliance on [Case] is misplaced. In [Case], [distinguishing facts]. Here, [different facts].
