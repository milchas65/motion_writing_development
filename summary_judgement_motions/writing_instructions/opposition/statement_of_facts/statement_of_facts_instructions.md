# Counter-Statement of Facts Instructions (Summary Judgment Opposition)

## Purpose
Present the facts in the light most favorable to you, the non-moving party, highlighting genuine disputes and evidence supporting your position.

## Structure

```
COUNTER-STATEMENT OF FACTS
(or STATEMENT OF FACTS)

A. [Background favorable to your position]

B. [Key disputed facts with your evidence]

C. [Facts movant ignores or mischaracterizes]
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Favorable Light
Present facts as a reasonable jury could find them in your favor. You're entitled to all favorable inferences.

### 2. Cite Your Evidence
Every material fact should be supported by:
- Your affidavits: (Smith Aff. ¶ 5)
- Depositions: (Jones Dep. 45:10-15)
- Documents: (Ex. A at 3)
- Movant's admissions (highlight these)

### 3. Respond to Movant's Statement
If required by local rules (Rule 56.1, Rule 19-a), file a response to movant's statement of facts:
- Admit undisputed facts
- Deny disputed facts with citation to contrary evidence
- Add additional material facts

### 4. Highlight Disputes
Explicitly note where evidence conflicts:
> Defendant claims [X]. (Def. SMF ¶ 15.) However, Plaintiff's evidence shows [Y]. (Smith Aff. ¶ 8; Ex. B at 2.)

## Content Elements

### Disputed Facts
For each key disputed fact:
- State movant's version
- State your contrary evidence
- Explain why a jury must resolve the dispute

### Ignored Evidence
Highlight evidence movant failed to address:
> Defendant's motion ignores entirely that [key fact]. (Citation.)

### Admissions Against Interest
Use movant's own evidence against them:
> Defendant's own documents show [damaging fact]. (Def. Ex. C at 4.)

### Credibility Issues
If witness credibility is at issue:
> Whether [witness] is credible is a question for the jury, not the court on summary judgment.

## Tone
- Factual and objective in presentation
- Advocacy through selection and emphasis
- Cite evidence for every assertion
- Do not argue the law in the facts section

## Responding to Rule 56.1 / Rule 19-a Statements
