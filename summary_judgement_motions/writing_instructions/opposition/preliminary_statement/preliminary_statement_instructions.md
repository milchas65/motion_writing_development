# Preliminary Statement Instructions (Summary Judgment Opposition)

## Purpose
Frame why summary judgment should be denied and preview the genuine issues of material fact.

## Structure

```
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

[Opening: State that summary judgment should be denied]

[Body: Preview the genuine disputes and evidence supporting your position]

[Closing: Note that factual disputes must be resolved by a jury]
```

## Content Elements

### Opening
State clearly that summary judgment is inappropriate:
> [Movant's] motion for summary judgment should be denied. Genuine issues of material fact preclude judgment as a matter of law.

### Preview of Genuine Disputes
- Identify the key facts that remain in dispute
- Reference your evidence (affidavits, depositions, documents)
- Show why a reasonable jury could find in your favor

### Evidence Preview
- Point to specific evidence creating disputes
- Note testimony, documents, or admissions that support your position
- Show that inferences favor you

### Credibility Issues (if applicable)
If the case turns on credibility:
> This case turns on disputed testimony that only a jury can resolve. [Movant's] witnesses say [X]; [Non-movant's] witnesses say [Y]. Summary judgment is inappropriate where credibility is at issue.

## Example

> Defendant's motion for summary judgment should be denied. The motion rests on Defendant's self-serving characterization of the evidence, ignoring the substantial record evidence that creates genuine issues of material fact.
>
> First, Plaintiff has submitted affidavit testimony from three witnesses establishing that Defendant made the alleged misrepresentations. Second, the contemporaneous documents contradict Defendant's claim of full performance. Third, Plaintiff's expert has identified deficiencies that Defendant's motion ignores entirely.
>
> Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff—as the Court must—summary judgment is plainly unwarranted. These factual disputes must be resolved by a jury.

## Tone
