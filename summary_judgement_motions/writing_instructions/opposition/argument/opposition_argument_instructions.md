# Argument Section Instructions (Summary Judgment Opposition)

## Purpose
Demonstrate that genuine issues of material fact exist on each claim, precluding summary judgment.

## Overall Structure

### Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)
- State that summary judgment must be denied
- Preview the genuine disputes that preclude judgment
- Emphasize the favorable standard of review

### Per-Claim Arguments
For EACH claim defendant seeks judgment on:

```
I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE DENIED ON [CLAIM TYPE]

    A. Genuine Issues of Material Fact Exist
       1. [Disputed Issue 1]
       2. [Disputed Issue 2]

    B. The Court Cannot Resolve These Disputes

    C. Defendant's Cases Are Distinguishable
```

## Identifying and Presenting Genuine Issues

### Structure for Each Dispute
1. Identify the material fact in dispute
2. State movant's position with citation
3. Present contrary evidence with citation
4. Explain why this dispute is material
5. Conclude that a jury must resolve it

### Example
> **The parties dispute whether Defendant knew of the defect.** Defendant claims its employees were "unaware of any problems" with the product. (Def.'s SMF ¶ 25; Smith Dep. 45:10-12.) But Plaintiff's evidence shows otherwise. The internal quality control report dated three weeks before the sale identified the precise defect at issue. (Ex. B at 3.) Defendant's production manager testified that he "probably saw" the report before the sale. (Jones Dep. 78:15-18.) This evidence creates a genuine dispute on the element of knowledge. A jury could credit Plaintiff's evidence and find that Defendant knew of the defect.

## Types of Opposition Arguments

### Conflicting Testimony
When witnesses give different accounts:

> The parties' witnesses offer conflicting accounts of the March 15 meeting. Defendant's representative testified that no promises were made about future business. (Smith Dep. 34:5-10.) Plaintiff's CEO testified that Defendant "guaranteed" continued orders for at least two years. (Jones Dep. 56:8-20.) These directly conflicting accounts create a classic credibility dispute that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.

### Documentary Evidence Supports Non-Movant
When documents create or support disputes:

> The contemporaneous documents support Plaintiff's account. The March 16 email from Defendant's representative states: "As I mentioned yesterday, we're committed to this partnership for the long term." (Ex. C.) A jury could interpret this statement as corroborating Plaintiff's testimony about the promises made at the March 15 meeting.

### Circumstantial Evidence Permits Inference
When direct evidence is lacking but circumstantial evidence supports the claim:

> While no witness heard Defendant instruct its employees to destroy documents, the circumstantial evidence permits an inference of spoliation. The documents were destroyed (1) after Plaintiff announced its intent to sue, (2) in violation of Defendant's own retention policy, and (3) under the direct supervision of Defendant's general counsel. (CSMF ¶¶ 35-40.) A jury could reasonably infer from these circumstances that the destruction was intentional.

### Expert Testimony Creates Dispute
When competing experts disagree:

> The parties' experts offer competing opinions on causation. Defendant's expert opines that the product defect could not have caused Plaintiff's injuries. (Def.'s Ex. D.) Plaintiff's expert concludes otherwise, explaining in detail how the defect led directly to the failure that injured Plaintiff. (Pl.'s Ex. E.) The Court cannot weigh this competing expert testimony on summary judgment.

### Contract Ambiguity
When contract terms are disputed:

> The contract language is ambiguous, creating a factual issue for trial. The Agreement provides that deliveries shall be made "promptly." Defendant interprets "promptly" to allow up to 30 days; Plaintiff contends it means within one week. Because both interpretations are reasonable, the ambiguity must be resolved by the factfinder. *See W.W.W. Assocs.*, 77 N.Y.2d at 163.

### Intent/State of Mind
When the claim requires proving intent:

> Defendant's state of mind is quintessentially a jury question. Defendant claims it acted in "good faith," but the evidence permits a contrary inference. Defendant's internal communications show [evidence of bad faith]. (Ex. B.) A jury could conclude from this evidence that Defendant acted with the required intent.

## Advanced Opposition Techniques

### Turning Movant's Evidence Against Them
Use defendant's own evidence to create disputes:

> Defendant's own documents undermine its motion. Defendant asserts it had no notice of the problem, but Defendant's production reveals a customer complaint filed two weeks earlier describing the exact same issue. (Ex. C.) Defendant's corporate representative could not explain why this complaint was not addressed. (Smith Dep. 89:5-15.) A jury could conclude that Defendant ignored known problems.

### Highlighting What Movant Ignored
Point out evidence movant failed to address:

> Notably, Defendant's motion ignores the testimony of its former employee, [Name], who stated in deposition that the company "knew the product had issues but shipped it anyway." (Jones Dep. 123:10-15.) This testimony alone creates a genuine dispute on the element of knowledge.

### The "Even If" Fallback
Provide alternative grounds for denial:

> Even if the Court were to accept Defendant's version of the disputed facts, summary judgment would still be improper. Defendant concedes it received the complaint letter on March 1. Under either party's interpretation of the contract, this triggered a duty to respond within 30 days. Defendant's April 15 response was untimely under any reading of the Agreement.

### Attacking Movant's Evidence Quality
Challenge the sufficiency of movant's proof:

> Defendant's evidence is insufficient to carry its burden. Defendant relies entirely on the self-serving declaration of its CEO, who has an obvious interest in the outcome. The declaration lacks foundation—it does not explain how the CEO has personal knowledge of the matters attested. And it is contradicted by contemporaneous documents. This inadequate evidentiary showing does not warrant shifting the burden to Plaintiff.

### Rule 56(d) / CPLR 3212(f) Discovery Argument
When discovery is incomplete:

> Summary judgment is premature because discovery is ongoing. As set forth in the accompanying affidavit, Plaintiff has not yet deposed [key witness] or obtained documents from [third party] that are essential to opposing this motion. (Smith Aff. ¶¶ 5-10.) The Court should deny the motion or grant a continuance under [Rule 56(d) / CPLR 3212(f)] to permit completion of discovery.

### Attack Opponent's Failure to Address Essential Element
Point out that opponent's motion papers are "devoid of" reference to a required element of their prima facie case:

> Plaintiff's moving papers are devoid of even any reference to amounts owed to Metropolitan Steel. This is an essential element of its prima facie case. On that basis alone its motion for summary judgment should be denied.

This technique is powerful when movant has simply failed to address something they must prove—shifting focus from your defenses to their inadequate showing.

### "Plaintiffs Rely Entirely On..." Attack
Highlight the weakness of opponent's evidentiary showing by emphasizing what they're relying on (especially if inadequate):

> In the present case, plaintiffs rely entirely on an attorney's affirmation to support their motion. They do not submit any competent, admissible evidence in support of their motion. They do not even attempt to address whether there was any money owed to [party] which is necessary to establish [element] and is an essential part of their prima facie case.

This framing emphasizes that opponent has failed to meet their burden without submitting contradictory evidence of your own.

### Personal Knowledge Attack (Separate POINT)
Dedicate a separate POINT section to attacking opponent's failure to submit an affidavit from a person with personal knowledge (per CPLR § 3212(b)):

> **POINT II: Plaintiffs have Failed to Support their Motion with an Affidavit by Someone with Personal Knowledge**
>
> The movant on a motion for summary judgment must make "a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, tendering sufficient evidence to eliminate any material issues of fact from the case." *Winegrad v. New York Univ. Med. Ctr.*, 64 N.Y.2d 851, 853 (1985). The affidavit "shall be by a person having knowledge of the facts." CPLR § 3212(b). An affidavit by a party's attorney with no personal knowledge of the operative facts is of no probative value and must be disregarded.

This can be a standalone ground for denial, independent of substantive arguments.

### Procedural Bar as Lead Argument (Point I)
When a procedural defect exists (motion made before joinder of issue, improper notice, jurisdictional defect), lead with it as Point I rather than burying it in substantive arguments:

> **POINT I: PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS PREMATURE**
>
> CPLR § 3212(a) provides that a motion for summary judgment "shall be made no earlier than thirty days after the filing of the note of issue, except with leave of court on good cause shown." Here, no note of issue has been filed. Indeed, no issue has been joined because Defendants have not yet been permitted to answer the amended complaint. On this basis alone, Plaintiffs' motion must be denied.

A procedural bar can defeat the entire motion without reaching the merits, saving argument on substantive issues for another day.

### "No Unconditional Admission" Defense
When movant claims you admitted liability or made concessions, attack by showing any admission was conditional:

> Plaintiffs' reliance on Defendants' alleged offer to tender the $100,000.00 deposit is misplaced. Defendants' offer to tender was subject to the express condition that an assignment and release be executed by Plaintiffs. Such a tender may not be deemed an admission of liability. *See Horn Waterproofing Corp. v. Bushwick Iron & Steel Co.*, 66 N.Y.2d 321, 326 (1985) (holding that a tender conditioned upon receipt of a release is not an unconditional admission of liability).

This defense is particularly useful when opponent characterizes settlement discussions or conditional offers as admissions.

### Failure to Adduce Proof of Amounts
Attack movant's failure to quantify or prove the specific amounts claimed with admissible evidence:

> Plaintiffs are unable to adduce any proof as to the amount of their alleged damages. Plaintiffs claim both a 50% interest in the loan and a 25% participation in the loan. Which one is it? How much principal is allegedly owed? How much interest has accrued, at what rate, and over what period? What is the current value of the collateral securing the loan? These are not rhetorical questions—they go to the heart of Plaintiffs' damages claim and remain entirely unaddressed. These material issues of fact require denial of the motion.

Uncertainty about quantum can defeat summary judgment even where liability might otherwise be established.

### Material Breach Defense Pattern
Structure material breach as an affirmative defense defeating contract claims:

> Plaintiffs materially breached their obligations under the Participation Agreement by:
>
> (a) failing to fund their share of the initial loan advance when called upon to do so;
> (b) refusing to participate in the workout negotiations with the Borrower;
> (c) unilaterally demanding full repayment while negotiations were ongoing.
>
> A party who has itself materially breached cannot enforce the contract against the other party. *See Merrill Lynch & Co. v. Allegheny Energy, Inc.*, 500 F.3d 171, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). Plaintiffs' own breaches bar their claims.

### "Nothing to Complain About" Dismissive Framing
When movant claims breach but their own conduct or inaction caused the alleged harm:

> Plaintiffs accepted the Participation Agreement and had every opportunity to work with the Borrower to protect their investment. They were invited to participate in the workout negotiations. They were offered the right to purchase additional participation interests. They simply chose not to take advantage of those opportunities. Having intentionally declined to participate in the very transactions they negotiated for themselves, Plaintiffs have nothing to complain about.

This frames opponent's claims as self-inflicted consequences of their own choices rather than actionable wrongs.

### "At a Minimum" Fallback Position
Use "at a minimum" to present a fallback position that defeats summary judgment even if the court rejects your primary arguments:

> Even if this Court were to find that Defendants owed some obligation to Plaintiffs under the Participation Agreement, at a minimum there exist genuine issues of material fact as to (1) the amount, if any, owed to Plaintiffs; (2) whether Plaintiffs themselves materially breached the Agreement first; and (3) the current value of the collateral securing the underlying loan. Any one of these disputed issues precludes summary judgment.

**Escalating Variant ("At the very least"):** Use this phrase to escalate from contract breach to bad faith when opponent's conduct warrants:

> At the very least, BANA's conduct constitutes a "disingenuous or dishonest failure to carry out," and "willful rendering of imperfect performance" of, the Indentures.

This variant:
- Signals that even under the most charitable interpretation, opponent's conduct is wrongful
- Escalates from breach to bad faith/willful misconduct
- Particularly effective when quoting contract language defining prohibited conduct

### "It Is Undisputed That..." Affirmative Framing
Transform opponent's failure to dispute facts into affirmative statements supporting your position:

> It is undisputed that no Noteholder has notified BANA of an intent to assert claims—or take any other action—with respect to the Impounded Income. (SMF ¶ 54, 58.)

> It is undisputed that BANA initiated the Interpleader without written direction or indemnity from the Required Minimum of Noteholders. (SMF ¶¶ 55-57, 59-61, 63.)

This technique:
- Converts **opponent's silence** into an affirmative statement
- Frames facts as **established** rather than merely alleged
- Creates building blocks for "there is no genuine dispute" arguments

### "Without Merit" Dismissive Transition
After stating opponent's justification, immediately dismiss it before systematic demolition:

> BANA claims that when a single noteholder offered its opinion that the contracts appeared ambiguous, BANA was obligated to commence an interpleader and charge its legal fees to all of the noteholders. BANA claims that these actions were necessary to protect the noteholders. **BANA's justifications are without merit.**

Then proceed to systematically dismantle each justification point by point. This structure signals confidence and creates a clear framework for the Court.

### Opponent's Conduct Contradicts Claimed Position
When opponent's stated justification is inconsistent with their actual conduct, highlight the contradiction:

> BANA's self-serving claims that it acted to protect noteholders' interests is contradicted by the undisputed facts; BANA claims that it is withholding money from *all* noteholders for the purpose of assisting a *single* noteholder to receive a windfall at the expense of all other noteholders in violation of the indentures.

> In light of the foregoing, BANA's bare assertion that it had "no choice," and was "constrained to bring the instant interpleader" because it was subject to liability from Noteholders lawsuits is a "mere pretext" that cannot support an interpleader.

This technique exposes **actions vs. words** inconsistency, which is particularly effective with sophisticated commercial parties.

### Using Recent Analogous Trial Court Decisions
When you find a recent trial court decision with similar facts that supports your position:

1. **Introduce it prominently:** "Recently, a trial court in Supreme Court, [County] County, [granted/denied] summary judgment... in a case very similar to the present case."
2. **Cite the decision:** Provide full citation
3. **Describe the parallel facts:** Show how the facts mirror your case
4. **Quote the holding:** State what the court found
5. **Attach as exhibit:** Annex a copy of the decision to your attorney affirmation

This technique works whether the decision supports denial (in opposition) or granting (in cross-motion).

### Numbered Catalogue of Bad Faith Evidence
In Preliminary Statement or Argument, use numbered paragraphs to catalogue opponent misconduct for cumulative effect:

> Defendants acted in bad faith throughout the valuation process. The undisputed record shows:
>
> (1) Defendants secretly engaged a new appraiser without disclosing this to Plaintiff (Nolan Aff. Ex. A, at 85-87);
>
> (2) when Defendants learned that Eide Bailly had determined the company's value to be $85 million, Defendant Edmunds called that conclusion "f**king nuts" and assured Defendant Lajous by text that they would "turn this around," again with no disclosure to Plaintiff (Nolan Aff. Ex. A, at 103-104; 109-111; Ex. B, at 122-125);
>
> (3) Defendants then engaged a new appraiser, Defendant Edmunds asking "will that lower the amount," to which Defendant Cohen replied "hopefully" (Nolan Aff. Ex. A, at 115-118);
>
> (4) ...

This structure:
- Creates powerful **cumulative effect** showing pattern of misconduct
- Each item has **specific fact + citation** for evidentiary support
- Numbers make the catalogue **easy to reference** in later argument
- Works particularly well for **fiduciary duty, fraud, and bad faith claims**

### "The Record Shows Just the Opposite" Turnabout
When movant makes a categorical factual assertion, quote it and directly contradict with evidence:

> Defendants claim in their moving brief that "the factual record is bereft of any basis to displace the good faith independent valuation." **The record shows just the opposite.** Defendants' own text messages reveal they called the independent appraiser's conclusion "f**king nuts" and immediately sought a new appraiser who would "lower the amount." (Ex. B at 122-125.)

This technique:
- Directly quotes and contradicts opponent's characterization
- Signals the court that movant's factual premise is false
- Transitions effectively into your evidentiary showing

### Text Message and Informal Communication Evidence
Text messages and informal emails often reveal true intent more effectively than formal documents:

> Defendant's text message to his co-manager states: "[W]e can turn this around." (Ex. B at 109.) When asked at deposition whether this meant he intended to manipulate the valuation process, Defendant was "uncomfortable" re-reading this text for the record. (Jones Dep. 145:8-15.)

Key patterns:
- **Quote exact text** including colloquialisms, profanity, and informal language
- **Profanity and candid language** = contemporaneous admissions ("f**king nuts", "hopefully", "[w]e can turn this around")
- **Note deposition discomfort** when witness is confronted with their own words—suggests consciousness of wrongdoing
- Informal communications are **more credible** than carefully drafted documents because they capture unguarded thoughts

### Expert Report Attack Enumerating Errors
Retain your own expert to critique opponent's expert report, then enumerate specific deficiencies:

> Plaintiff's expert, [Name], reviewed [Opponent's Expert]'s valuation report and identified **nineteen (19) errors, false premises, and biased assumptions** underlying the conclusions. (Expert Aff. ¶¶ 15-34.) [Expert] concludes that [Opponent's Expert]'s analysis is "not credible and... not in conformity with generally accepted valuation practices normally relied upon by valuation analysts." (Expert Aff. ¶ 35.)

This technique:
- **Specific number of errors** makes critique concrete and damning
- **Professional standards violation** undermines opponent's expert
- Creates genuine dispute of material fact requiring trial

### Waiver Footnote Attack
Use a footnote to dispose of an argument on procedural waiver grounds before reaching the merits:

> ¹ Initially, Defendants failed to assert this as an affirmative defense in their Answer, and therefore waived this defense. *See Marshall v. Payne*, N16C-12-197 VLM, 2018 WL 5308176, at *2 (Del. Super. Ct. Oct. 25, 2018).

This technique:
- **Disposes of argument without reaching merits**
- Keeps waiver issue **subordinate to substantive arguments** (footnote rather than main text)
- Preserves your page budget for stronger arguments
- Effective for affirmative defenses opponent failed to plead

### "Freeze Out" Narrative Framing
For cases involving exclusion from decision-making, establish a consistent theme of plaintiff's exclusion while defendants acted secretly:

> Defendants froze out Ragab from the valuation process entirely. They engaged a new appraiser "to Ragab's exclusion" (Nolan Aff. Ex. A at 87); communicated with that appraiser "again without disclosure to Ragab" (id. at 103); and negotiated the final valuation figure in conversations from which "Ragab was excluded entirely" (id. at 156).

This technique:
- **Repeating variations** builds pattern: "froze out," "to [Plaintiff]'s exclusion," "without disclosure to [Plaintiff]," "[Plaintiff] was excluded entirely"
- Creates narrative of **intentional concealment**
- Particularly effective for **fiduciary duty and LLC/partnership disputes**

### Turning Opponent's Cited Cases Against Them
Show that movant's own authorities actually support your position:

> Even the cases cited by Defendants recognize that a breach of fiduciary duty claim is not duplicative and will survive independently of a breach of contract claim where it arises from a fiduciary relationship. *See Metro Stor. Intl. LLC v. Harron*, 275 A.3d 810, 843-44 (Del. Ch. 2022) (cited by Defendants) (holding that fiduciary duty claims survive where they "arise from defendants' roles as fiduciaries" rather than mere contract performance).

**Extended Application—Misapplied Procedural Cases:**
When opponent cites cases for propositions those cases don't actually support:

> BANA's reliance on its cited cases for this argument is misplaced. The *Citadel* case cited by BANA for the proposition that an indenture trustee owes duties to all noteholders, not just those in a particular class, does not in any way support BANA's conclusory assertion that it was obligated to breach its contractual duties to the Class A Noteholders under the Agreements.

This variant:
- Identifies the proposition opponent claims the case supports
- Shows the case does **not** support that specific proposition
- Labels opponent's reasoning as "conclusory" or "misplaced"

This technique:
- **Undermines opponent's legal argument** using their own support
- Signals to the court that opponent has **misread or mischaracterized** the law
- More persuasive than simply citing your own cases

### Using Opponent's Withdrawn Offer Against Them
When opponent has offered to settle or tender payment during the dispute, use this to undermine their claimed justifications:

> BANA's offer to disburse to the Class A Noteholders belies its claimed justification for commencing the interpleader. BANA's offer to disburse suggests that, notwithstanding its stated concern about "claims" by Class B Noteholders, BANA recognized its contractual obligation to disburse to the Class A Noteholders.

This technique:
- Shows **opponent's own conduct contradicts** their stated position
- Settlement offers (when not subject to Rule 408 protection) reveal opponent's true assessment
- Particularly effective when opponent later reverses course

### Dual Independent Grounds for SJ Denial
Structure your opposition to present **independent bases** for denial, so the motion fails even if the court rejects some arguments:

> Prima's motion should be denied on two independent grounds:
>
> First, Prima cannot establish the amount of any damages allegedly owed. Prima's moving papers fail to identify, with any specificity, what amounts it claims are due.
>
> Second, Prima itself materially breached the Participation Agreement by refusing to fund its share of additional advances when called upon to do so.

This structure:
- Creates **multiple independent grounds** for denial
- Court must reject **all** grounds to grant the motion
- Frames the opposition as having **belt-and-suspenders** strength

### "As an Initial Matter" Threshold Framing
Use "as an initial matter" to front-load threshold arguments that defeat opponent's motion before reaching the merits:

> As an initial matter, Prima cannot establish an essential element of its prima facie case—the amount of damages. Prima's motion is devoid of any proof quantifying its alleged damages.

> As an initial matter, summary judgment is premature because discovery is not complete. As set forth in the accompanying affidavit, Defendant has not yet deposed key witnesses.

This phrase:
- Signals a **threshold defect** that is independently dispositive
- Creates hierarchy: if threshold argument succeeds, court need not reach merits
- Particularly effective for evidentiary gaps, procedural defects, or missing elements

### Structured Enumeration of Contract/Agreement Flaws
Use lowercase Roman numerals with semi-colon separation to enumerate specific deficiencies in opponent's contractual interpretation or conduct:

> Prima's argument that BANA was obligated to disburse immediately upon demand fails for multiple reasons: (i) the Indenture grants BANA discretion in timing of disbursements (Indenture § 4.3); (ii) the demand was not in proper form as required by Section 5.2; (iii) Prima failed to provide the indemnification required by Section 5.8(c); and (iv) Prima's own prior breaches suspended BANA's performance obligations.

This format:
- Creates **scannable list** of specific deficiencies
- Each item is **independently sufficient** to defeat the argument
- Semi-colon separation keeps enumeration tight within a single paragraph
- Useful when challenging contract interpretation arguments

### Footnote Documenting Opponent's Inconsistent Conduct
Use footnotes to document opponent's shifting positions or inconsistent conduct without interrupting argument flow:

> Prima's claim that it was entitled to immediate payment is inconsistent with its own prior conduct.³
>
> _______________
> ³ Prima initially demanded disbursement on March 1, then withdrew that demand on March 15 after learning of the ongoing workout negotiations, then renewed the demand on April 1 after negotiations failed to produce a settlement favorable to Prima. This shifting position undermines Prima's assertion that immediate payment was contractually required.

This technique:
- Documents **pattern of inconsistency** without derailing main argument
- Preserves page budget for substantive points
- Creates record of opponent's credibility issues for the court

### Exposing Opponent's Economic Motivation
Unmask opponent's self-interest to undermine the credibility of their legal position:

> Prima's motivation is obvious: if the St. Louis Galleria B-1 Note is not an Impaired Interest but, instead, reverts to being a Collateral Interest, then funds collected on that asset would be distributed to the subordinated Junior Noteholders—the vast majority of whom are Prima's clients. However, the 2006 Indenture is clear, particularly with regard to Collateral Interests that are Commercial Mortgage Loans: once a foreclosure or default "has occurred," that Collateral Interest becomes an Impaired Interest.

This technique:
- Shows **why** opponent is taking an untenable position
- Converts abstract legal dispute into concrete **financial self-interest**
- Undermines opponent's credibility without ad hominem attacks
- Particularly effective when opponent's interpretation would financially benefit them

### "Both Arguments Are Meritless" Collective Dismissal
State opponent's arguments, then dismiss them collectively before systematic rebuttal:

> Instead, citing only its general management powers under the Collateral Management Agreement entered into on or about November 6, 2006 (the "Collateral Management Agreement"), Prima makes two arguments to support its position. **Both arguments are meritless.**
>
> First, Prima claims that the grant of authority in § 1(b) of the Collateral Management Agreement permits it to reclassify Impaired Interests...
>
> Second, Prima relies on its right to "cure" impairments...

This structure:
- **Frames opponent's arguments** before dismantling them
- **Signals confidence** through collective dismissal
- Creates clear roadmap for systematic rebuttal
- Works well when opponent has made multiple weak arguments

### "Contrary to [Opponent]'s Contention" Direct Rebuttal
Signal you're addressing opponent's specific argument, then demolish it:

> Contrary to Prima's contention, this plain reading of the Transaction Documents does not render a "cure" meaningless. Holders of Preferred Shares can exercise a "Cure Advance" to protect their interests by paying off any payment defaults on Collateral Interests before those interests become Impaired Interests.

> Contrary to Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff "never complained," the contemporaneous emails establish otherwise.

This phrase:
- **Credits opponent with an argument** before refuting it
- Shows you're engaging with opponent's actual position
- Creates point-counterpoint structure judges expect
- More persuasive than ignoring opponent's argument

### Procedural Bar for Unauthorized Action
Show opponent failed to follow required contractual procedures for the change they seek:

> Prima has not even attempted to follow the amendment procedures in the 2006 Indenture. Specifically, Section 8.2 of the 2006 Indenture provides that amendments to the 2006 Indenture may be made, but "no... supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Collateral Manager, as the case may be, without the consent of each Holder of each Outstanding Note of each Class affected thereby:
>
> (a)... change the provisions of this Indenture relating to the application of proceeds of any Collateral...
>
> (g) modify... the Priority of Payments..."
>
> Prima's desired change requires "the consent of each Holder" of each affected Class. Prima certainly has not received nor sought any such consent, and Prima should not be permitted to skirt the protections set forth in the 2006 Indenture by effectively amending the 2006 Indenture without complying with the amendment procedures.

This argument:
- Shows opponent is **circumventing required procedures**
- **Quotes specific procedural requirements** opponent failed to follow
- Effective for contract disputes where opponent seeks unilateral action
- Creates independent ground for denial based on procedural failure

## Defending Against Common SJ Arguments

### Against "No Evidence" Arguments
When movant claims non-movant lacks evidence:

> Defendant's assertion that Plaintiff has "no evidence" of reliance is simply false. The record contains: (1) Plaintiff's testimony that he relied on Defendant's representations (Pl. Dep. 67:3-15); (2) contemporaneous emails showing Plaintiff asked follow-up questions about the representations (Ex. B); and (3) evidence that Plaintiff changed position in reliance on the representations (Ex. C). This is more than sufficient to create a genuine issue.

### Against "Conclusory" Attacks
When movant characterizes your evidence as conclusory:

> Defendant dismisses Plaintiff's evidence as "conclusory," but the record says otherwise. Plaintiff's affidavit is based on personal knowledge, identifies specific facts, and is corroborated by documentary evidence. Unlike the bare assertions rejected in [movant's cited case], Plaintiff provides detailed testimony about what was said, when, and by whom. (Smith Aff. ¶¶ 12-18.)

### Against "Sham Affidavit" Claims
When movant alleges contradiction with prior testimony:

> Defendant's "sham affidavit" argument fails. The affidavit does not contradict Plaintiff's deposition testimony; it supplements it. At deposition, Plaintiff testified that she "did not recall" the specific date—not that the event never occurred. The affidavit, prepared after review of documents that refreshed Plaintiff's recollection, provides additional detail. This is precisely what the sham affidavit doctrine permits.

### Against "Immateriality" Arguments
When movant claims disputed facts are immaterial:

> Defendant's assertion that the disputed facts are "immaterial" ignores the elements of the claim. To establish breach of fiduciary duty, Plaintiff must prove breach and causation. The disputed facts—whether Defendant disclosed the conflict of interest and whether that non-disclosure caused Plaintiff's loss—go directly to these elements. These are quintessentially material facts.

## Distinguishing Movant's Cases

### Factual Distinctions
> The cases Defendant cites are readily distinguishable. In *Smith v. Jones*, the court granted summary judgment because the plaintiff "offered no evidence whatsoever" to counter defendant's documentary proof. 123 F.3d at 456. Here, Plaintiff has submitted substantial evidence, including witness testimony, contemporaneous documents, and expert opinions.

### Procedural Distinctions
> *Brown v. Corp.* is inapposite because it was decided at trial, not on summary judgment. The court's findings there reflected its assessment of witness credibility after hearing live testimony. At this stage, the Court cannot make such credibility determinations.

### Legal Standard Distinctions
> Defendant's reliance on *Wilson v. Company* is misplaced. That case applied the heightened "clear and convincing evidence" standard applicable to fraud claims at trial. On summary judgment, Plaintiff need only show a genuine dispute exists—not prove its case by any evidentiary standard.

## Citation Practice

### Citing Your Evidence
- Counter-statement: (CSMF ¶ 12)
- Your affidavits: (Jones Aff. ¶ 5)
- Your exhibits: (Pl.'s Ex. B at 3)
- Depositions (for your points): (Smith Dep. 78:3-15)

### Citing Movant's Evidence (to distinguish or turn)
- Defendant's statement: (Def.'s SMF ¶ 12)
- Defendant's exhibits: (Def.'s Ex. A at 5)
- Use movant's evidence against them when possible

### Citing Cases
- Cite cases denying summary judgment on similar facts
- Use parentheticals: *(denying summary judgment where evidence was conflicting)*
- Distinguish movant's cases explicitly

### Delaware Chancery LLC Fiduciary Duty Citations
For LLC disputes governed by Delaware law, cite to Delaware Chancery Court decisions:

Key cases for LLC fiduciary duty:
- *Feeley v. NHAOCG, LLC*, 62 A.3d 649 (Del. Ch. 2012) (duty of loyalty and duty of care in LLC context)
- *Metro Stor. Intl. LLC v. Harron*, 275 A.3d 810 (Del. Ch. 2022) (breach of fiduciary duty claims survive separately from contract claims where arising from fiduciary relationship)
- *In re MultiPlan Corp. Stockholders Litig.*, 268 A.3d 784 (Del. Ch. 2022) (entire fairness standard for self-interested transactions)

Standards to cite:
