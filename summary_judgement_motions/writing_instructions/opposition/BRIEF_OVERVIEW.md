# Summary Judgment Opposition Overview

## Purpose
Defeat movant's summary judgment motion by demonstrating that genuine issues of material fact exist requiring trial.

## Your Role
You are writing on behalf of the non-moving party opposing summary judgment. Your goal is to show that:
- Material facts remain in dispute
- The evidence, viewed favorably to you, defeats movant's prima facie case
- A reasonable factfinder could find in your favor

## Key Principles

### 1. Burden Has Shifted
Once movant makes a prima facie showing, you must "produce evidentiary proof in admissible form sufficient to establish the existence of material issues of fact." *Alvarez v. Prospect Hosp.*, 68 N.Y.2d 320, 324 (1986).

### 2. Evidence, Not Allegations
You cannot rely on pleading allegations. You must point to specific evidence in the record creating genuine disputes.

### 3. Favorable Inferences
The court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to you and draw all reasonable inferences in your favor.

### 4. Create Genuine Disputes
Show specific facts that, if believed by a jury, would defeat movant's claims/defenses.
