# Parties Instructions (Summary Judgment Motion - Moving)

## Purpose
In summary judgment motions, party identification is typically brief and integrated into the Statement of Facts or preliminary matter.

## When to Include Separate Parties Section
- Multi-party litigation where not all parties are involved
- Need to establish corporate relationships
- Party identity is relevant to the merits (alter ego, agency, etc.)

## When to Integrate into Statement of Facts
- Standard two-party litigation
- Party relationships are part of the factual narrative
- No disputes about party identity

## Content (if separate section)

```
THE PARTIES

Plaintiff [NAME] is a [description]. [Relevant background to claims.]

Defendant [NAME] is a [description]. [Relevant background to defenses.]
```

## Key Elements for Summary Judgment
- Focus on facts relevant to standing, capacity, or liability
- Establish relationships relevant to the claims
- Keep brief unless party identity is contested

## Note
In most summary judgment motions, parties are identified in the Statement of Facts rather than a separate section.
