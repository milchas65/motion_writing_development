## Content Elements

### "Crux of the Dispute" Opening
Distill the case to a single dispositive question:

> This motion presents a straightforward question: Did Defendant fully perform under the Agreement? The undisputed documentary evidence answers that question conclusively in Defendant's favor.

**For contract interpretation cases:**
> The crux of this dispute is whether [contractual issue]. Under the clear and unambiguous terms of the [Agreement], the answer is clearly [yes/no].

### Preview of Undisputed Facts
- Identify the key undisputed facts
- Reference documentary evidence
- Show why no genuine issue exists

### Legal Grounds
- State the legal standard that entitles movant to judgment
- Identify which claim(s)/defense(s) fail as a matter of law
- Preview the absence of evidence on essential elements

### Exposing Opponent's Economic Motivation (Optional)
When helpful, unmask opponent's self-interest:
> Plaintiff's position is driven by economic self-interest. If Plaintiff's interpretation were adopted, it would receive [benefit], despite [contractual/legal obstacle].

## Example

> This motion presents a single question of contract interpretation: whether the no-action clause in Section 5.8 of the Indenture bars Plaintiff from prosecuting this action. It does.
>
> The undisputed evidence establishes that Plaintiff never complied with the no-action clause's requirements before commencing suit. Plaintiff never provided the requisite notice to the Trustee. Plaintiff never obtained the requisite consent of 25% of noteholders. And Plaintiff never offered indemnification. Under controlling authority, these failures are fatal.
>
> Defendant is entitled to summary judgment dismissing the complaint.
