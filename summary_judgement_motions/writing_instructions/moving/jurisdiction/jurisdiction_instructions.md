# Jurisdiction Instructions (Summary Judgment Motion - Moving)

## Purpose
Summary judgment motions typically do not require a separate jurisdiction section because they are filed in pending litigation where jurisdiction has already been established.

## When Jurisdiction Section Is NOT Needed
- Motion filed in pending action
- No jurisdictional defenses raised
- Standard FRCP 56 or CPLR 3212 motion

## When Jurisdiction Section MAY Be Needed
- Summary judgment on jurisdictional defense (personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction)
- Forum selection clause enforcement
- Standing challenge

## Procedural Authority

### Federal (FRCP 56)
> Summary judgment is proper when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

### New York (CPLR 3212)
> "The proponent of a summary judgment motion must make a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, tendering sufficient evidence to demonstrate the absence of any material issues of fact." *Alvarez v. Prospect Hosp.*, 68 N.Y.2d 320, 324 (1986).

## Note
Procedural authority for the summary judgment standard is typically addressed in the Legal Standard section of the Argument, not in a separate Jurisdiction section.
