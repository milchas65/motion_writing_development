# Statement of Undisputed Material Facts Instructions

## Purpose
Present the factual foundation for summary judgment through numbered paragraphs, each supported by record citations. This is the evidentiary backbone of your motion.

## Terminology
- **New York (Commercial Division):** Rule 19-a Statement of Material Facts
- **Federal:** Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts
- **California:** Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts

## Format

### Standard Format
```
STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS

1. On [date], Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a [type of agreement]. (Ex. A; Smith Aff. ¶ 3.)

2. Section 4.1 of the Agreement provides: "[quoted provision]." (Ex. A § 4.1.)

3. On [date], Defendant delivered the [product/service] to Plaintiff. (Smith Aff. ¶ 5; Ex. B.)

4. Plaintiff signed a written acceptance of the deliverable on [date]. (Ex. C.)

...
```

### NY Commercial Division Format (Rule 19-a)
The Rule 19-a Statement should begin with a formal introductory paragraph referencing the legal standard before the numbered facts:

**Simple Introduction:**
```
STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS PURSUANT TO RULE 19-a

     Defendant The Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Limited (the "Bank"), as and
for its Statement of Material Facts Pursuant to Rule 19-a in support of its
motion for summary judgment states as follows:
```

**Formal Introduction with Legal Standard:**
```
PRIMA CAPITAL ADVISORS LLC'S STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACTS
PURSUANT TO RULE 19-a OF THE RULES OF THE COMMERCIAL DIVISION

     In support of its cross-motion for summary judgment pursuant to CPLR 3212,
and in accordance with Rule 19-a of the Rules of the Commercial Division of the
Supreme Court, Interpleader Defendant and Interpleader Counterclaim Plaintiff
Prima Capital Advisors LLC ("Prima") respectfully submits this statement of
material facts as to which Prima contends there is no genuine issue to be tried.¹

                         MATERIAL UNDISPUTED FACTS

Prima's Commercial Mortgage Investment Vehicles
───────────────────────────────────────────────

     1. In May 2005, Prima created an investment vehicle that issued notes...
```

The formal introduction:
- References CPLR 3212 (summary judgment statute)
- Cites Rule 19-a explicitly
- States the legal standard ("no genuine issue to be tried")
- Uses footnote to identify evidentiary support per Rule 19-a(d)

**Example:**

     1. Plaintiff Art Capital Bermuda Ltd. ("Art Capital") and [Borrower]
("Borrower 1") executed a Secured Promissory Note dated April 28, 2014
("Note 1") memorializing a secured loan by Art Capital to Borrower in the
amount of $5,100,000. (See Affirmation of Charles M. Miller, dated
November 9, 2017 ("Miller Aff."), Ex. C.)

     2. Loan 1's Maturity Date was April 28, 2017. (Id. § 3.)

...
```

### Key Formatting Rules
- **Numbered paragraphs** (continuous numbering)
- **One fact per paragraph** (not compound facts)
- **Record citation for every fact** (in parentheses after the fact)
- **Simple, declarative sentences**
- **Chronological or thematic organization**

### Table of Contents (For Lengthy Statements)
For statements exceeding 15-20 pages or 50+ paragraphs, include a Table of Contents on page 2:

```
TABLE OF CONTENTS
                                                                      Page

```

This approach:
- Provides **roadmap** for complex factual presentations
- **Telegraphs organization** to the court
- **Professional touch** expected in BigLaw filings
- Pairs with Roman numeral section headings in body

## Content Principles

### 1. State Facts, Not Arguments
**Good:**
> 15. Plaintiff did not file a written objection within the 30-day period specified in Section 5.2 of the Agreement. (Smith Aff. ¶ 12; Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 8.)

**Bad:**
> 15. Plaintiff breached the Agreement by failing to file a timely objection. [This is a legal conclusion]

### 2. One Fact Per Paragraph
**Good:**
> 12. On March 5, 2023, Defendant sent an email to Plaintiff regarding the project status. (Ex. D.)
>
> 13. In that email, Defendant stated: "[quoted text]." (Ex. D at 2.)

**Bad:**
> 12. On March 5, 2023, Defendant sent an email to Plaintiff stating "[quoted text]," and Plaintiff responded the next day agreeing with the assessment, and thereafter Defendant proceeded with the project as discussed. [Too many facts in one paragraph]

### 3. Cite Admissible Evidence
Every fact must be supported by evidence that would be admissible at trial:
- **Affidavits/Declarations:** Personal knowledge required
- **Depositions:** Testimony of witness with knowledge
- **Documents:** Authenticated or self-authenticating
- **Admissions:** Party admissions, RFA responses
- **Interrogatory Responses:** Sworn responses to interrogatories

### 4. Quote Key Language
For contractual provisions, communications, and critical statements, quote directly:

> 8. Section 7.3 of the Agreement provides: "Client shall provide written notice of any deficiency within fifteen (15) days of delivery. Failure to provide timely notice shall constitute acceptance." (Ex. A § 7.3.)

For critical correspondence, include extended quotes with precise dollar amounts written out in full:

> 34. By letter to the Bank dated June 27, 2017, Plaintiffs advised that they had calculated the total amount of interest and principal accrued to the Bank in respect of Loan 1 as of Loan 1's Maturity Date to be $5,265,000. (*See* Miller Aff. Ex. O at 3.) Accordingly, by that letter Bluefin, on behalf of Art Capital, tendered and was prepared to deliver to the Bank's undersigned counsel hereto within five Business Days of receiving such letter, via bank checks or wire transfers, the total amount of Four Million Eight Hundred Twenty Eight Thousand One Hundred Thirty Four and 27/100 ($4,828,134.27) Dollars, which amount Plaintiffs acknowledged is "now due under the aforesaid Participation Agreements" pertaining to Loan 1. (*Id.*)

### 5. Define Terms Inline
Define all key terms with parentheticals on first use. This creates shorthand for the entire document and reduces repetition:

**Parties:**
> 1. Plaintiff Art Capital Bermuda Ltd. ("Art Capital") and John Smith ("Borrower 1") executed a Secured Promissory Note...

**Documents:**
> ...executed a Secured Promissory Note dated April 28, 2014 ("Note 1") memorializing a secured loan...

**Evidence Sources:**
> (*See* Affirmation of Charles M. Miller, dated November 9, 2017 ("Miller Aff."), Ex. C.)

Once defined, use the shorthand consistently throughout: `(Miller Aff., Ex. D.)`, `(Id. § 3.)`, `Art Capital`, `Note 1`.

**Footnotes for Complex Definitions:** Use footnotes to define document abbreviations and explain party roles without cluttering the main text:

> ¹ References to "Am. VCC" are to the Bank's Amended Answer and Verified Counterclaims filed with the Court on October 17, 2017. Copies of Plaintiff's Verified Amended Complaint, filed with the Court on August 28, 2017, and the Am. VCC are attached to the Miller Aff. as Exhibits A and B, respectively.
>
> ² Bluefin is the servicer of the loans at issue in this action, pursuant to a Servicing Agreement dated April 28, 2014. A copy of the Servicing Agreement is attached to the Miller Aff. as Exhibit G.

**Footnotes Defining Multiple Evidence Sources:** For complex cases with many evidence sources, use footnotes to define all abbreviations upfront. Reference Rule 19-a(d) for evidentiary support:

> ¹ In accordance with Rule 19-a(d), evidentiary support for the statements of material fact stated herein is contained in the July 7, 2010 Affirmation of Charles M. Miller In Support Of Prima Capital Advisors LLC's Motion For Summary Judgment ("Miller Aff.").
>
> ² Because the relevant provisions of the Indentures are identical, citations will be made collectively to "Indenture § __." (Miller Aff. Ex. B and H.)
>
> ³ Because the relevant provisions of the CMAs are identical, citations will be made collectively to "CMA § __." (Miller Aff. Ex. C and I.)
>
> ⁴ Citations to "White Aff. __" shall refer to the Affidavit of Gregory A. White, dated July 7, 2010.
>
> ⁵ Citations to "Prima ¶ __" refer to Prima's Statement of Claim set forth in the Answer, Defenses, Statement of Claim, and Counterclaim of Prima Capital Advisors LLC, filed on April 19, 2010.
>
> ⁶ Citations to "BANA __" refer to BANA's Memorandum of Law in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss Prima's Second Affirmative Defense and Counterclaims, filed on June 2, 2010.

This approach allows you to cite diverse sources concisely in the body: `(Prima ¶ 20; White Aff. ¶ 3, BANA 1.)`

### 6. Build Toward Legal Conclusions
Organize facts to naturally lead the reader to your legal conclusions:

**For Statute of Limitations Defense:**
> 20. Plaintiff first learned of the alleged defect on January 15, 2020. (Pl. Dep. 45:3-8.)
>
> 21. On that date, Plaintiff contacted Defendant to complain about the issue. (Ex. F; Pl. Dep. 45:15-20.)
>
> 22. Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on March 1, 2024. (Complaint, filed Mar. 1, 2024.)
>
> 23. The period between January 15, 2020 and March 1, 2024 is four years and forty-five days.

## Organization Approaches

### Chronological
Best for: Contract disputes, timelines of events, fraud claims

```
A. Formation of the Agreement (¶¶ 1-5)
B. Performance Under the Agreement (¶¶ 6-12)
C. The Alleged Breach (¶¶ 13-18)
D. Subsequent Events (¶¶ 19-25)
```

### Thematic
Best for: Complex commercial disputes, multiple claims/defenses

```
A. The Parties (¶¶ 1-3)
B. The Governing Agreements (¶¶ 4-10)
C. Defendant's Performance (¶¶ 11-20)
D. Plaintiff's Approvals and Acceptances (¶¶ 21-28)
E. Plaintiff's Failure to Object (¶¶ 29-32)
```

### Roman Numeral Thematic Sections
Best for: Lengthy statements (50+ ¶¶), breach of fiduciary duty, multi-element defenses, BigLaw filings

Use I., II., III. format with ALL CAPS descriptive titles for maximum formality:

```
I.    THE FORMATION OF SHR CAPITAL LLC.

      1.    SHR Capital LLC ("SHR Capital" or the "Company") is a Delaware
limited liability company that was formed on January 1, 2011 and that
maintained, prior to its bankruptcy, a principal place of business in New
York County, New York. (Rubin Aff. at Ex. 1 [LLC Agreement at P0040553].)

      2.    The LLC Agreement, at Section 1.03, stated: "The principal
business activity and purpose of the LLC shall initially be to acquire
substantially all of the assets of the Gogotech Entities..." Id. at P0040561.

      ...

II.   HASSAN RAGAB'S TRANSFER OF HIS PERFORMANCE UNITS TO TWO PERSONAL
      TRUSTS.

      8.    The LLC Agreement included restrictions on the transfer of SHR
Capital's equity. Id. at P0040557.

      ...

III.  THE TERMINATION OF RAGAB'S AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT.

      14.   Ragab was terminated as CEO without cause (as defined in the LLC
Agreement), on January 14, 2021. (Rubin Aff. at Ex. 2 [Am. Compl. at ¶ 30].)

      ...
```

This structure:
- **Most formal** organization approach
- **Each section addresses** a distinct element or phase
- **ALL CAPS titles** with periods create visual hierarchy
- **Pairs with Table of Contents** for lengthy statements
- **Typical in BigLaw filings** for complex commercial disputes

### Letter-Numbered Thematic Subheadings
Best for: Complex multi-contract disputes, securitizations, cases with distinct transactional components

Use A., B., C. format for major thematic sections instead of roman numerals. This provides clear visual hierarchy while maintaining simplicity:

```
A. The CDO Transactions
───────────────────────

     1. In May 2005, Prima created the 2005 CDO, an investment vehicle that
issued notes to investors (the "2005 Noteholders"). (Miller Aff., Ex. A.)

     2. In December 2006, Prima created a second investment vehicle, the 2007
CDO. (Id., Ex. G.)

     ...

B. The Indentures
─────────────────

     10. The 2005 Issuer entered into an Indenture dated May 24, 2005 (the
"2005 Indenture") with LaSalle Bank National Association. (Miller Aff. Ex. B.)

     11. The 2007 Issuer entered into an Indenture dated December 14, 2006
(the "2007 Indenture") with BANA as Trustee. (Id., Ex. H.)

     ...

C. The Credit Default Swaps
───────────────────────────

     25. In addition to commercial mortgages, the CDOs invested in credit
default swaps ("CDS"). (White Aff. ¶ 8.)

     ...
```

This structure:
- **Groups related transactions** under letter headings
- **Maintains continuous numbering** across sections
- **Provides clear visual breaks** between major topics
- **Simplifies references** ("As set forth in Section A above...")

### Argumentative Letter Subheadings
Best for: Persuasive narrative SOFs in combined opposition/cross-motion briefs, cases where opponent's misconduct is central

Take the letter-numbered format further by using **argumentative characterizations** in the subheadings themselves:

```
A. The CDO Transactions

B. The Indentures And Collateral Management Agreements

C. The Credit Default Swaps And Impaired Interests

D. Prima's Authority To Direct BANA

E. Bank Of America's Indemnity And Limitations On Liability

F. No Noteholder Has Notified BANA Of An Intent To Assert Claims

G. No Noteholder Has Complied With The No Action Clause

H. Bank Of America Ignores The No Action Clause, Commences
   Litigation, And Uses The Noteholders' Money To Pay Its
   Attorneys' Fees
```

Note how subheading H is not merely descriptive—it embeds the argumentative characterization ("Ignores," "Uses The Noteholders' Money") that the facts will support. This technique:
- **Telegraphs the narrative arc** to the court
- **Frames neutral facts** in your favor before the reader encounters them
- **Creates natural POINT headings** for the argument section
- **Most effective in later subheadings** after establishing neutral factual foundation (A-E above)

Use sparingly—1-2 argumentative subheadings per statement, typically toward the end covering the opposing party's conduct.

### Thematic Subheadings with Numbered Paragraphs
Best for: Complex cases with 50+ paragraphs (securitizations, multi-contract disputes, regulatory matters)

For lengthy Rule 19-a Statements, use **bold underlined subheadings** to organize numbered paragraphs into logical sections:

```
                         MATERIAL UNDISPUTED FACTS

Prima's Commercial Mortgage Investment Vehicles
───────────────────────────────────────────────

     1. In May 2005, Prima created an investment vehicle that issued notes
(the "2005 Notes") to investors (the "2005 Noteholders"). (Miller Aff., Ex. A.)
The investment vehicle is comprised of Prima Capital CDO 2005-1 Ltd. (the "2005
Issuer") and Prima Capital 2005-1 CDO Corp. (Id.)

     2. The 2005 Issuer, Prima Capital CDO 2005-1 Corp., and LaSalle Bank
National Association ("LaSalle") entered into an Indenture dated May 24, 2005
(the "2005 Indenture"). (Id., Ex. B.)

     ...

The Notes And Payments To Noteholders
─────────────────────────────────────

     15. The 2005 Issuer issued 9 classes of 2005 Notes under the 2005
Indenture, which classes are identified in order of seniority (highest to
lowest) as classes A-1 through H. (Miller Aff. Ex. A; White Aff.⁴ ¶ 2.)

     ...

Impairment Of Collateral Interests
──────────────────────────────────

     28. The Indentures provide that a Collateral Interest that is a commercial
mortgage is deemed an "Impaired Interest" where such mortgage is subject to
"foreclosure or default (whether or not declared)..." (Indenture § 1.1
(definition of "Impaired Interest").)

     ...

Bank Of America's Indemnity, Limitations On Liability, And The Noteholder Lawsuits
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     51. The Indentures state that:

          The Issuer agrees ... to indemnify (both in its individual capacity
          and as Trustee) the Trustee and its Officers, directors, employees
          and agents for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss,
          liability or expense incurred without negligence, willful
          misconduct, fraud or bad faith on their part...

(Indenture § 6.7(iii).)
```

This structure:
- **Groups related facts** under descriptive headings
- **Maintains continuous numbering** across sections
- **Guides the reader** through complex factual narratives
- **Telegraphs themes** that support legal arguments

### Thematic Subheadings (Narrative Format)
For narrative Statements of Facts in combined briefs, use bold thematic subheadings to guide the reader through complex facts:

```
STATEMENT OF FACTS

**The Participation Agreement**
In January 2019, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into a Participation Agreement
whereby Plaintiffs would acquire a participation interest in a loan to Borrower...

**The Loan and Initial Funding**
The underlying loan was made to Borrower in the principal amount of $2,000,000.
Defendants funded 75% of the loan; Plaintiffs were to fund 25%...

**The Default and Workout Negotiations**
In March 2020, Borrower defaulted on its payment obligations. Defendants immediately
commenced workout negotiations with Borrower to restructure the debt...

**Plaintiffs' Refusal to Participate**
Despite repeated invitations, Plaintiffs refused to participate in the workout
negotiations or to fund their pro rata share of additional advances needed to
protect the collateral...
```

This format makes lengthy fact sections digestible and telegraphs the narrative themes that support your legal arguments.

### By Element
Best for: Straightforward claims where you're establishing each element

```
A. The Contract (¶¶ 1-5)
B. Defendant's Performance (¶¶ 6-12)
C. Plaintiff's Breach (¶¶ 13-18)
D. Defendant's Damages (¶¶ 19-22)
```

**Element-Tracking Within Paragraphs:** Organize facts to track each element of your claim or defense:
- **Agreement exists:** Execution facts, parties, date, terms
- **Obligation defined:** "Pursuant to [Agreement], [Party] was obligated to..."
- **Performance by your client:** What your client did under the agreement
- **Non-performance by opponent:** Failure to pay, deliver, perform
- **Damages/amounts due:** Specific calculations, tender letters, demands

Each fact should support a specific legal element. If a fact doesn't advance an element, consider whether it's truly material.

### Element-by-Element Defense Structure
Best for: Breach of fiduciary duty, professional malpractice, fraud claims where you must negate multiple elements

Structure your statement to methodically defeat each element of opponent's claim:

```
I.   THE FORMATION OF SHR CAPITAL LLC.         → Background/Context
     (¶¶ 1-7)

II.  HASSAN RAGAB'S TRANSFER OF HIS            → Plaintiff's Status/Rights
     PERFORMANCE UNITS. (¶¶ 8-13)

III. THE TERMINATION OF RAGAB'S AT-WILL        → Triggering Event
     EMPLOYMENT. (¶¶ 14-16)

IV.  THE ENGAGEMENT OF EIDE BAILLY LLP.        → ELEMENT: Proper Process
     (¶¶ 17-21)                                 (Shows duty was followed)

V.   EIDE BAILLY'S VALUATION. (¶¶ 22-50)       → ELEMENT: Independence/Good Faith
                                                (Shows no improper influence)

VI.  HASSAN RAGAB DISPUTED THE VALUATION.      → Plaintiff's Conduct
     (¶¶ 51-52)                                 (Shows plaintiff had opportunity)

VII. SHR CAPITAL COMMENCED CHAPTER 7           → Current Status/Mootness
     LIQUIDATION. (¶¶ 53-55)
```

For breach of fiduciary duty claims, establish:
- **Proper process followed:** Contractual requirements satisfied
- **Independence:** Decision-maker was independent, unbiased
- **Good faith:** Actions taken in good faith, no self-dealing
- **No improper influence:** No directing, manipulating, or controlling
- **Plaintiff's access:** Plaintiff had opportunity to participate/object

Each Roman numeral section should defeat or undermine a specific element of plaintiff's claim.

### Building Block Organization
Best for: Complex cases requiring layered factual foundation (securitizations, regulatory disputes, multi-party transactions)

Structure facts to build logically from foundation to conclusion:

```
1. STRUCTURE (¶¶ 1-10)
   - What entities exist
   - What agreements govern their relationships
   - Who has what roles and duties

2. MECHANICS (¶¶ 11-25)
   - How payments/performance flows work
   - What triggers events or obligations
   - What conditions must be satisfied

3. EVENTS (¶¶ 26-40)
   - What happened chronologically
   - What changed (defaults, cures, notices)
   - What determinations were made

4. ACTIONS (¶¶ 41-55)
   - What your client directed or did
   - What opponent did or failed to do
   - What resulted from the actions

5. BREACH/LIABILITY (¶¶ 56-65)
   - How opponent's conduct violated agreements
   - What notice/opportunity existed
   - What damages or consequences followed
```

This structure:
- **Educates the reader** before presenting disputes
- **Establishes foundational facts** opponent cannot dispute
- **Creates logical inevitability** toward your conclusion
- **Mirrors how courts analyze** contract disputes

### Parallel Transaction Pattern
Best for: Cases involving multiple similar transactions (e.g., multiple loans, invoices, shipments)

When multiple similar transactions are at issue, use an identical fact structure for each to reinforce the pattern:

```
LOAN 1 (¶¶ 1-13)
  - Execution of note (date, amount, parties)
  - Maturity date
  - Borrower's payment obligation
  - Participation agreement execution
  - Bank's participation amount paid
  - Defendant's remittance obligations (interest + principal)
  - Failure to remit

LOAN 2 (¶¶ 14-23)
  [Same structure repeated]

LOAN 3 (¶¶ 24-33)
  [Same structure repeated]

TENDER AND DISPUTE (¶¶ 34-39)
  - Tender letters with calculations
  - Rejection of tender
  - Current status
```

This parallel structure:
- Makes the repetitive breach pattern unmistakable
- Simplifies the court's analysis
- Makes it harder for opponent to dispute the pattern

## Evidence Types and Citations

### Affidavits/Declarations
```
(Smith Aff. ¶ 12.)
(Decl. of John Smith ¶ 12, Ex. 1 to Smith Decl.)
```

### Deposition Transcripts
```
(Jones Dep. 45:10-46:3.)
(Dep. of Mary Jones at 45:10-46:3.)
```

**Deposition Q&A Block Quotes:** For critical testimony, quote the entire Q&A exchange verbatim to preserve exact language:

> 39. Ragab testified regarding the involvement of two Individual Defendants (David Lazier and Uri Cohen) stating:
>
> > Q. Other than the information that you have already testified about, are you aware of any conduct of Uri Cohen that you believe improperly influenced Eide Bailly's valuation of SHR Capital?
> >
> > A. Well, I would qualify that by saying that unless I've missed something in the document discovery process, I'm not aware that Uri Cohen was ever in contact, direct contact, with Eide Bailly. . . . So if he influenced the process at all, he did it indirectly through other board members.
> >
> > Q. Do you believe that David Lazier improperly influenced Eide Bailly's valuation of SHR Capital?
> >
> > A. Again, very similar to Uri Cohen, I don't have any evidence that I'm aware of, and I may be forgetting evidence, but I don't have any evidence that I'm aware of that David Lazier was ever in contact with Eide Bailly.
>
> (Rubin Aff. Ex. 19 [Ragab Tr. at 232:24-234:7].)

This technique:
- **Preserves exact Q&A format** so court sees precisely what was asked and answered
- **Eliminates paraphrasing disputes** - opponent cannot claim mischaracterization
- **Particularly effective** for qualified admissions and damaging testimony
- **Use sparingly** for most critical exchanges (3-5 per statement maximum)

### Documentary Exhibits
```
(Ex. A at 3.)
(Ex. A § 4.2.)
(Smith Aff., Ex. B.)
```

### Affirmation Exhibit with Bracketed Description
For complex exhibits, use bracketed descriptions on first use with defined term and Bates number:

**First use (full description):**
```
(Rubin Aff. at Ex. 1 [December 31, 2014 SHR Capital Partners LLC Second
Amended & Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of
December 31, 2014 (the "LLC Agreement") at P0040553 and P0040556].)
```

**Subsequent uses (shorthand):**
```
(Rubin Aff. at Ex. 1 [LLC Agreement at P0040619].)
(Rubin Aff. Ex. 1 [LLC Agreement at P0040572].)
Id. at P0040561.
```

This pattern:
- **Full description in brackets** establishes what the exhibit is
- **Defined term** creates shorthand for subsequent citations
- **Bates numbers** provide precision for specific pages
- **Subsequent citations** use shorthand bracket reference

### Bates Number Formats
Use consistent Bates number formats for document precision:

```
RAGAB002610                    [Party prefix + sequential numbers]
P0040553                       [Production prefix + sequential numbers]
EB 00008924                    [Entity prefix + sequential numbers]
RAGAB004407 - RAGAB004408      [Page range for multi-page documents]
```

When citing Bates-stamped documents:
```
(Rubin Aff. Ex. 14 [Valuation at RAGAB004407 - RAGAB004408].)
(Rubin Aff. Ex. 3 [Ragab Trust Documents at P0005564 - P0005565].)
Id. at RAGAB002610.
```

### Discovery Responses
```
(Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 5.)
(Def.'s Resp. to RFA No. 12 (admitting).)
(Pl.'s Resp. to RFP No. 15 (stating no documents exist).)
```

### Pleading Admissions
```
(Compl. ¶ 15 (admitting execution of the Agreement).)
(Answer ¶ 8 (admitting receipt of notice).)
```

### Verified Pleadings (Powerful for Admissions)
Opponent's own verified pleading allegations cannot be disputed:
```
(Am. VCC ¶ 38.)
(Verified Amended Complaint ¶ 42.)
(Verified Answer and Counterclaims ¶ 65.)
```

### Contract Section Citations
```
(Id. § 3.)
(Id. §§ 2, 4(a) and (b).)
(Ex. A § 7.3.)
(Agreement § 12.1(a).)
```

### Collective Citations for Parallel Documents
When multiple documents have identical relevant provisions, define a collective citation in a footnote:

> ² Because the relevant provisions of the Indentures are identical, citations will be made collectively to "Indenture § __." (Miller Aff. Ex. B and H.)
>
> ³ Because the relevant provisions of the CMAs are identical, citations will be made collectively to "CMA § __." (Miller Aff. Ex. C and I.)

This simplifies citations throughout the statement and avoids repetitive dual references.

### Combined Citation Formats
When citing multiple sources for one fact:
```
(Miller Aff., Ex. C.)                    [Affirmation + Exhibit]
(Miller Aff. Ex. O at 3.)                [Affirmation Exhibit + page]
(*See* Miller Aff., Ex. D.)              [Cross-reference with See]
(Smith Aff. ¶ 5; Ex. B.)                 [Affidavit + separate Exhibit]
(Am. VCC ¶ 38; Miller Aff., Ex. A.)      [Verified pleading + Exhibit]
```

**Multiple Diverse Sources:** When corroborating a fact with multiple types of evidence, combine them:
```
(Prima ¶ 20; White Aff. ¶ 3, BANA 1.)    [Own pleading + affidavit + opponent's memo]
(Prima ¶ 30; White Aff. ¶ 6; BANA 8, 10.) [Multiple sources with multiple ¶¶]
(Miller Aff. Ex. G; White Aff. ¶ 2.)     [Affirmation exhibit + separate affidavit]
(White Aff. ¶ 34, Ex. F.)                [Affidavit + exhibit to that affidavit]
```

**"See also" Cross-References:** Add corroborating citations without cluttering the main cite:
```
(Rubin Aff. Ex. 13 [Sperling Tr. at 108:5-12, 118:5-18, 120:2-6, 141:17-20];
see also Sperling Tr. at 121:19-123:9 (discussing Ragab's provision of
hundreds of pages of valuation materials).)

(Rubin Aff. Ex. 11 [Edmunds Tr. at 85:19-22]; Rubin Aff. Ex. 12 [Lajous Tr.
at 93:4-17]; see also Rubin Aff. Ex. 15 [Christensen Tr. at 12:10-14].)
```

This technique:
- **Primary citation first**, then "see also" for additional support
- **Parenthetical** explains relevance of "see also" cite
- **Useful for testimony** from multiple witnesses on same point

### Third-Party Business Records
Establish facts through independent third-party sources:

```
(Rubin Aff. Ex. 9 [Office of the Minnesota Secretary of State, Business
Records for Eide Bailly LLP].)

(Rubin Aff. Ex. 10 [Eide Bailly Website, Eide Bailly Locations].)

(Rubin Aff. Ex. 16 [NACVA Professional Standards at 4].)
```

Useful third-party records:
- **Secretary of State records** (corporate registration, status)
- **Professional standards** (industry requirements, ethical rules)
- **Website printouts** (office locations, public statements)
- **Government filings** (bankruptcy petitions, regulatory filings)
- **Industry publications** (market data, economic reports)

These sources:
- **Establish independence** without relying solely on party testimony
- **Difficult to dispute** as objective third-party evidence
- **Corroborate party testimony** with external verification

## Techniques for Effective Statements

### Anticipate Denials
Draft facts that are difficult to deny:
- Quote documents verbatim
- Cite opponent's own testimony and admissions
- Reference undisputed public records
- Rely on authenticated documents

### Use Opponent's Evidence
Facts supported by opponent's own evidence are powerful and virtually undeniable:

> 25. Plaintiff testified that she "understood there were risks" associated with the investment. (Pl. Dep. 87:14-16.)

> 26. In response to Interrogatory No. 12, Plaintiff stated: "Plaintiff reviewed the risk disclosure documents prior to signing the Agreement." (Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 12.)

**Opponent's Deposition Admissions:** Use opponent's own testimony to establish facts they cannot dispute. Particularly effective for qualified admissions:

> 41. Ragab further testified that he was "allowed to speak to the valuation team on two occasions," "allowed to send them e-mails," "allowed to send them attachments," and "in a strict sense, [] wasn't entirely frozen out." (Rubin Aff. Ex. 19 [Ragab Tr. at 60:17-61:4].)

> 36. Ragab testified that he was unrestricted in what he could supply Eide Bailly:
>
> > Q. And you were unrestricted in what you could supply to Eide Bailly, correct?
> >
> > A. Unrestricted in the sense that I could send anything I wanted to them, is that what you mean?
> >
> > Q. Yes.
> >
> > A. I suppose that's true.
>
> (Rubin Aff. Ex. 19 [Ragab Tr. at 169:24-170:13].)

This technique:
- Pattern: "[Opponent] testified that..." followed by damaging admission
- **Qualified admissions** ("in a strict sense," "I suppose") still establish the fact
- **Opponent's own words** become undisputable facts
- Combine with Q&A block quotes for maximum impact

**Verified Pleading Admissions:** Cite opponent's Verified Complaint or Verified Answer for admissions—opponent cannot dispute their own sworn allegations:

> 5. Pursuant to PA-1, the Bank paid Art Capital a Participation Amount of $4,590,000 to purchase a 90% ownership stake in Loan 1. (Am. VCC ¶ 38.)

> 7. In connection with Art Capital's increasing the amount of Loan 1, the Bank paid Art Capital an additional $675,000 to maintain its 90% ownership stake, bringing its full Participation Amount in Loan 1 to $5,265,000. (Am. VCC ¶ 42.)

### Establish Negatives
When the absence of something is important:

> 30. Plaintiff did not send any written notice to Defendant between March 1, 2023 and June 15, 2023. (Smith Aff. ¶ 15 (stating no notice was received); Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 8 (identifying no such notice).)

> 31. Defendant's files contain no written objection from Plaintiff during the notice period. (Smith Aff. ¶ 16.)

**Comprehensive Negative Fact Pattern:** When stating non-performance, cover all potentially responsible parties in a single statement to foreclose arguments about alternative obligors:

> 12. Neither Art Capital, Bluefin, nor any of their Affiliates have, at any time since the inception of Loan 1, remitted any payments of principal in respect of the Bank's $5,265,000 Participation Amount in Loan 1. (*Id.* ¶ 3.)

> 13. Neither Art Capital, Bluefin, nor any of their Affiliates have remitted any payments of interest on the Bank's $5,265,000 Participation Amount in Loan 1 since November 2016. (Day Aff. ¶ 2.)

This formulation:
- Names all parties who might have had an obligation
- Specifies the time period (since inception / since date)
- Identifies the specific obligation (principal vs. interest)
- Ties to specific amounts

**Establishing Negatives Through "I Do Not Recall" Testimony:** Quote witness testimony establishing lack of contact, communication, or knowledge:

> 40. Eide Bailly testified that it did not have any communications with, or receive any information from, David Lazier or Uri Cohen, stating:
>
> > Q. Do you recall at any point receiving any information from David Lazier?
> >
> > A. I do not recall.
> >
> > Q. Do you recall at any point during the course of your valuation speaking to David Lazier?
> >
> > A. I do not recall.
> >
> > Q. Do you know who David Lazier is?
> >
> > A. I -- I -- not -- not currently, no.
> >
> > Q. Do you recall having any discussions with Uri Cohen?
> >
> > A. I don't -- I don't recall having any discussions with him.
> >
> > Q. But you had no interactions with him during the course of your valuation exercise; is that correct?
> >
> > A. That's correct.
>
> (Rubin Aff. Ex. 13 [Sperling Tr. at 138:25-140:13].)

This technique:
- **Ask about each party individually** to establish comprehensive lack of contact
- **Cumulative "I do not recall" answers** establish what did NOT happen
- **Final confirmation question** ("is that correct?") cements the negative
- Particularly effective for **fiduciary duty/improper influence claims**

**"No Provision" Pattern for Absence of Duties:** When establishing that a contract imposes no duty, use repeated "No provision" statements citing the entire document:

> 11. No provision of the Indentures imposes on BANA an affirmative duty to review Issuer Orders to determine whether they are potentially invalid. (*See* Indentures.)
>
> 12. No provision of the Indentures imposes on BANA an affirmative duty to examine the relevant agreements to determine whether there is explicit authority for an Issuer Order. (*Id.*)
>
> 13. No provision of the Indentures imposes on BANA an affirmative duty to consider whether there is a reasonable argument that would render an Issuer Order invalid. (*Id.*)
>
> 14. No provision of the Indentures imposes on BANA an affirmative duty to examine the Issuers' or Prima's motives to determine whether there is any reason to question an Issuer Order. (*Id.*)

This pattern:
- Establishes **absence of contractual duty** through repeated negatives
- **Cites the entire document** (`(*See* Indentures.)`) to support the assertion
- **Forecloses arguments** that the duty exists elsewhere in the agreement
- **Builds cumulative force** through repetition

Use variations for different contexts:
- "No provision of the [Agreement] permits [Party] to..."
- "The [Agreement] does not include any provision permitting [Party] to..."
- "There is no provision of the [Agreement] that expressly prohibits..."

**"Nowhere in the Definition" Pattern:** When disputing that a defined term includes a claimed requirement, use this stronger formulation:

> 15. Nowhere in the definition of "Event of Default" is there any reference to a requirement that the Trustee investigate the validity of an Issuer Order. (*See* Indenture § 1.1 (definition of "Event of Default").)
>
> 16. Nowhere in the definition of "Collateral Manager" is there any reference to a fiduciary duty to Noteholders. (*See* CMA § 1.1 (definition of "Collateral Manager").)

This pattern:
- Emphasizes what a **definition does NOT include**
- Stronger than generic "no provision" for **definitional disputes**
- Pairs well with quoting the actual definition to show omission

**"Does Not State/Contain" Pattern:** For direct assertions about what contract language omits:

> 20. Section 6.3 of the Indenture does not state that the Trustee must independently verify the authority behind an Issuer Order. (*See* Indenture § 6.3.)
>
> 21. The CMA does not contain any provision requiring Prima to obtain Noteholder consent before issuing payment instructions. (*See* CMA.)
>
> 22. The definition of "Impaired Interest" does not state that the Trustee must conduct an independent investigation. (Indenture § 1.1 (definition of "Impaired Interest").)

This pattern:
- Makes **direct negative assertions** about specific provisions
- Pairs with **contract quotes** to show absence by comparison
- Useful when opponent claims language implies an obligation that isn't stated

### Quote Critical Contract Terms
For contract-based arguments, quote the operative provisions:

> 7. Section 8.2 of the Agreement provides:
>
> "Any claim for breach of this Agreement must be brought within one (1) year of the date the claiming party knew or should have known of the alleged breach. Failure to bring a claim within this period shall constitute a waiver."
>
> (Ex. A § 8.2.)

**Indented Block Quotes for Lengthy Provisions:** For complex contract provisions, use indented block quotes to preserve exact language and improve readability:

> 7. The CMAs state that:
>
> > The Issuer hereby appoints Prima to act as the Collateral Manager under this Agreement and to manage the Collateral Interests in accordance with the limitations described herein and in the Indenture and Prima accepts such appointment. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Issuer appoints the Collateral Manager as its representative to take actions permitted or required by it under the Trust Agreement in accordance with this Agreement and the Indenture. The Issuer hereby agrees to comply with all directions of the Collateral Manager made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indenture.
>
> (CMA § 1(a).)

> 22. The Indentures define "Available Distribution Amount" as:
>
> > With respect to each Payment Date, Interest Proceeds and Principal Proceeds in respect of the Collateral Interests and Eligible Investments received during the related Due Period, plus any payments received from the Timing Swap Counterparty under the Timing Swap Agreements with respect to such Payment Date, less any amounts required to reimburse Nonrecoverable Advances made by the Advancing Agents or the Trustee, as applicable, together with the interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate, in each case plus any Interest Advances made by an Advancing Agent or the Trustee, as applicable with respect to such Payment Date.
>
> (Indenture § 1.1 (definition of "Available Distribution Amount").)

**Quote Contract Definitions:** When contract uses defined terms, quote the definition with parenthetical citation:

> 20. Interest received from a Collateral Interest is deemed "Interest Proceeds" under the Indentures. (Indenture § 1.1 (definition of "Interest Proceeds").)
>
> 21. Principal received from a Collateral Interest is deemed "Principal Proceeds" under the Indentures. (Indenture § 1.1 (definition of "Principal Proceeds").)
>
> 28. The Indentures provide that a Collateral Interest that is a commercial mortgage is deemed an "Impaired Interest" where such mortgage is subject to "foreclosure or default (whether or not declared) with respect to the underlying Commercial Mortgage Loan." (Indenture § 1.1 (definition of "Impaired Interest").)

**Contractual Obligation Pattern:** Use "Pursuant to [Agreement]..." to establish obligations with specific section citations:

> 10. Pursuant to Amended PA-1, Art Capital was obligated to cause Bluefin to remit interest to the Bank on its $5,850,000 Participation Amount at the rate defined therein. (Miller Aff., Ex. F §§ 2, 4(a) and (b).)

> 11. Pursuant to Amended PA-1, Art Capital was obligated to cause Bluefin to remit to the Bank the Bank's *pro rata* share of principal amounts repaid by Borrower 1. (*Id.* § 4(a).)

This pattern:
- Identifies the source of the obligation ("Pursuant to...")
- States who was obligated to do what
- Cites the specific contract section
- Builds the foundation for showing breach

### Corporate Officer Affidavit with Specific Figures
For financial facts, use an affidavit from a corporate officer (VP, CFO, Controller) with personal knowledge of the financial details. Include specific dollar amounts that will be difficult to dispute:

> As set forth in the accompanying affidavit of Richard Ortiz, vice president of Tishman:
>
> 10. Metropolitan Steel's original subcontract value was $4,750,000. (Ortiz Aff. ¶ 5; Ex. A.)
>
> 11. Four change orders were issued to Metropolitan Steel having a net value of $142,092. (Ortiz Aff. ¶ 6; Exs. B-E.)
>
> 12. Metropolitan Steel's adjusted subcontract value was $4,892,092. (Ortiz Aff. ¶ 7.)
>
> 13. Metropolitan Steel was paid by Tishman the sum of $4,771,548.45. (Ortiz Aff. ¶ 8; Ex. F (payment summary).)
>
> 14. The amounts spent by Tishman in completing and correcting Metropolitan Steel's work totaled $1,634,351.36. (Ortiz Aff. ¶ 12; Ex. G (cost breakdown).)

This approach:
- Uses a corporate officer with personal knowledge of the business records
- Provides specific, precise figures that are hard to dispute
- Ties each figure to both affidavit testimony AND supporting exhibits
- Builds the mathematical foundation for your legal argument

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Legal Conclusions
**Wrong:**
> 15. Plaintiff breached the Agreement.

**Right:**
> 15. Plaintiff failed to make the payment due on March 1, 2023. (Ex. D; Smith Aff. ¶ 10.)

### 2. Argumentative Language
**Wrong:**
> 18. Plaintiff inexplicably ignored multiple warnings about the deadline.

**Right:**
> 18. Defendant sent emails to Plaintiff on January 5, January 15, and January 28, 2023, reminding Plaintiff of the February 1 deadline. (Exs. E, F, G.) Plaintiff did not respond to any of these emails. (Smith Aff. ¶ 14.)

### 3. Compound Facts
**Wrong:**
> 10. Defendant delivered the product on March 1, Plaintiff inspected it on March 3, Plaintiff sent an email expressing satisfaction on March 5, and Plaintiff authorized final payment on March 10.

**Right:**
> 10. Defendant delivered the product on March 1, 2023. (Ex. B; Smith Aff. ¶ 8.)
>
> 11. Plaintiff inspected the product on March 3, 2023. (Pl. Dep. 34:5-10.)
>
> 12. On March 5, 2023, Plaintiff sent an email to Defendant stating: "Everything looks good. Nice work." (Ex. C.)
>
> 13. Plaintiff authorized final payment on March 10, 2023. (Ex. D.)

### 4. Facts Without Citations
Every fact must have a record citation. No exceptions.

### 5. Characterizations of Evidence
**Wrong:**
> 20. Plaintiff admitted that she knew the investment was risky.

**Right:**
> 20. When asked whether she understood the risks, Plaintiff testified: "Yes, I understood there were risks. They gave me the disclosure documents." (Pl. Dep. 87:14-18.)

## Length and Scope
- Include only **material** facts—those relevant to the motion
- Typical length: 20-50 numbered paragraphs (varies by complexity)
- Local rules may impose page or paragraph limits
- Quality over quantity: every fact should serve a purpose

## Local Rule Compliance

### New York Commercial Division (Rule 19-a)
- Statement must be submitted with motion papers
- Short and concise statement—no argument
- Opponent must submit counter-statement responding to each paragraph

### Federal (Local Rule 56.1)
- Check specific local rules of your district
- Typically requires separate statement filed with motion
- Opponent must respond paragraph-by-paragraph
- Failure to respond may result in facts deemed admitted

### California
- Separate statement required
- Must identify each material fact and supporting evidence
- Format requirements strictly enforced
