# Argument Section Instructions (Summary Judgment Motion)

## Purpose
Demonstrate that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on each claim or defense.

## Overall Structure

### Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)
- State that summary judgment is appropriate under the governing standard
- Preview the claims/defenses at issue and why each warrants judgment

### Per-Claim Arguments
For EACH claim or defense:

```
I. SUMMARY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE GRANTED ON [CLAIM TYPE]

    A. Elements of [Claim Type]

    B. The Undisputed Evidence Establishes [Dispositive Element(s)]
       1. [Key Fact Category 1]
       2. [Key Fact Category 2]

    C. Plaintiff Cannot Raise a Genuine Issue of Material Fact

    D. Summary Judgment Is Warranted
```

## Element-by-Element Analysis

### A. State the Elements
- Cite the controlling case for the elements
- List each element clearly
- Identify which element(s) are dispositive

### B. Show Undisputed Facts Satisfy/Defeat Elements
For EACH dispositive element:
1. State the element required
2. Cite the specific undisputed facts (SMF ¶ __) and record evidence
3. Explain how the evidence conclusively establishes/negates the element
4. Cite cases where summary judgment was granted on similar facts

### C. Explain Why No Genuine Issue Exists
Anticipate and defeat potential arguments:
- Address any contrary evidence and explain why it's insufficient
- Show opponent cannot point to admissible evidence creating dispute
- Distinguish any cases opponent might cite

### D. Request Judgment
- Conclude that judgment is warranted as a matter of law
- Specify judgment sought (dismissal, judgment on defense, etc.)

## Types of Summary Judgment Arguments

### Negating an Essential Element

**Plaintiff's Claim Fails:**
> Plaintiff cannot establish the reliance element of its fraud claim. The undisputed evidence shows that Plaintiff conducted its own due diligence, consulted independent advisors, and made the investment decision based on information from multiple sources—not Defendant's alleged misrepresentations. (SMF ¶¶ 34-42.)

**Structure:**
1. Identify the essential element
2. Show evidence that negates it
3. Explain why opponent's contrary evidence (if any) is insufficient
4. Cite comparable cases

### Establishing Affirmative Defense

> Summary judgment is warranted on Defendant's statute of limitations defense. The undisputed evidence establishes that Plaintiff knew of the alleged injury no later than March 2019 (SMF ¶¶ 15-18), yet did not commence this action until June 2023—more than four years later. The claim is time-barred as a matter of law.

**Structure:**
1. State the defense and its elements
2. Show undisputed facts establishing each element
3. Explain why no genuine issue exists
4. Apply the law to the facts

### No Evidence of Element

When discovery is complete and opponent lacks evidence:

> Plaintiff has failed to adduce any evidence of causation. Despite full discovery, Plaintiff has not identified any witness, document, or expert opinion establishing that Defendant's alleged conduct caused Plaintiff's damages. "Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial." *Matsushita*, 475 U.S. at 587. Summary judgment is required.

### Documentary Evidence Is Dispositive

When documents conclusively establish the facts:

> The documentary evidence is dispositive. The signed Agreement expressly provides that "[quoted provision]." (Ex. A § 4.2.) Plaintiff's written acceptance dated March 15, 2023, confirms compliance with all specifications. (Ex. B.) The contemporaneous email chain shows Plaintiff had no complaints during the relevant period. (Ex. C.) Against this documentary evidence, Plaintiff offers only self-serving declarations that contradict the written record.

### Opponent's Admissions Are Fatal

Using discovery responses and deposition testimony:

> Plaintiff's own testimony defeats its claim. At deposition, Plaintiff admitted:
>
> Q: Did Defendant ever tell you the investment was risk-free?
> A: No. They gave me a risk disclosure.
>
> (Pl. Dep. 87:14-16.) Plaintiff further admitted in interrogatory responses that it "understood there were risks associated with the investment." (Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 12.) These admissions negate the fraud claim as a matter of law.

## Advanced Argument Techniques

### Burden-Shifting Framework
Structure arguments to show proper burden allocation:

> Defendant has met its initial burden by demonstrating, through undisputed documentary evidence, that it fully performed under the Agreement. (SMF ¶¶ 25-35.) The burden now shifts to Plaintiff to "produce evidentiary proof in admissible form sufficient to establish the existence of material issues of fact." *Alvarez*, 68 N.Y.2d at 324. Plaintiff cannot meet this burden.

### "Conclusory Allegations Are Insufficient"
When opponent relies on unsupported assertions:

> Plaintiff's opposition rests on conclusory assertions devoid of evidentiary support. "[M]ere conclusions, expressions of hope or unsubstantiated allegations or assertions are insufficient" to defeat summary judgment. *Zuckerman v. City of New York*, 49 N.Y.2d 557, 562 (1980). Plaintiff must point to specific evidence in the record creating a genuine dispute. It cannot.

### "Sham Affidavit" Doctrine
When opponent submits an affidavit contradicting prior testimony:

> Plaintiff's late-filed affidavit contradicts her own deposition testimony and should be disregarded. "A party may not create a material issue of fact to defeat summary judgment by submitting an affidavit that contradicts [her] prior deposition testimony." *Mack v. United States*, 814 F.2d 120, 124 (2d Cir. 1987). At deposition, Plaintiff testified she never saw the document. Now she claims otherwise. This transparent attempt to manufacture a factual dispute should be rejected.

### Immateriality of Disputed Facts
When some facts are disputed but don't affect the outcome:

> Even accepting Plaintiff's version of the disputed facts, summary judgment is still warranted. Plaintiff disputes the precise date of the conversation, but this dispute is immaterial. Regardless of whether the conversation occurred in January or February 2022, Plaintiff's claim accrued more than three years before the complaint was filed. The statute of limitations bars the claim under either timeline.

### Absence of Expert Testimony
When opponent's claim requires expert support:

> Plaintiff's professional malpractice claim fails as a matter of law for lack of expert testimony. To establish a departure from accepted professional standards, expert evidence is required. *Ocasio-Hernandez v. Fortuño-Burset*, 640 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2011). Discovery has closed. Plaintiff has not designated an expert and cannot offer one now. Summary judgment is mandatory.

### Contract Interpretation as Matter of Law
When the contract is unambiguous:

> Contract interpretation is a question of law when the terms are unambiguous. *W.W.W. Assocs. v. Giancontieri*, 77 N.Y.2d 157, 162 (1990). The Agreement's language is clear: "[quoted provision]." No extrinsic evidence is needed to interpret this plain language. Defendant is entitled to summary judgment enforcing the Agreement as written.

### Undisputed Breach + Undisputed Damages
For straightforward contract claims:

> The undisputed evidence establishes each element of Defendant's breach of contract counterclaim:
>
> - **Contract:** The parties executed the Agreement on [date]. (SMF ¶ 5; Ex. A.)
> - **Performance:** Defendant fully performed by delivering [goods/services]. (SMF ¶¶ 12-18; Smith Aff. ¶¶ 5-10.)
> - **Breach:** Plaintiff failed to pay the $500,000 due on [date]. (SMF ¶ 22; Ex. D.)
> - **Damages:** Defendant remains unpaid. (SMF ¶ 23; Jones Aff. ¶ 8.)
>
> Plaintiff has offered no evidence disputing any of these facts. Summary judgment on the counterclaim is warranted.

### "No Fund to Attach" Defense (Derivative Claims)
When plaintiff's claim is derivative (mechanic's lien, subrogation, third-party beneficiary), argue there's no underlying fund because the primary obligor was overpaid, defaulted, or costs exceeded contract value:

> A second tier vendor's lien only extends to the amount owed to the party with whom it had its contract at the time its lien was filed. As set forth in Mr. Ortiz's affidavit, there were no such monies owed to Metropolitan Steel at the time plaintiff filed its liens. Due to Metropolitan Steel's default and the costs incurred by Tishman in completing Metropolitan Steel's scope of work, not only were there no monies due Metropolitan Steel, but Tishman spent significant sums in excess of Metropolitan Steel's remaining contract balance to complete and correct the work.

**Structure:**
1. Explain the derivative nature of plaintiff's claim
2. Identify what fund/source plaintiff's claim depends on
3. Show the underlying fund is exhausted or never existed
4. Cite cases applying the "no fund" principle

### Offset/Completion Cost Defense
Argue that backcharges, completion costs, correction costs, or liquidated damages offset any amounts owed, depleting or eliminating the fund available to claimant:

> Metropolitan Steel's original subcontract value was $4,750,000. Metropolitan Steel was paid $4,771,548.45. The amounts spent by Tishman in completing and correcting Metropolitan Steel's work totaled $1,634,351.36. That means Tishman spent $1,513,807.81 more than the unpaid amount remaining in Metropolitan Steel's contract value in completing and correcting its work.

This argument is particularly powerful in construction cases where completion costs often exceed the original subcontractor's remaining balance.

### Using Recent Analogous Trial Court Decisions
When you find a recent trial court decision with similar facts that resulted in summary judgment:

1. **Introduce it prominently:** "Recently, a trial court in Supreme Court, [County] County, granted summary judgment dismissing an action... in a case very similar to the present case."
2. **Cite the decision:** *NJE Transportation Co. LLC v. River City Construction Services et al*, 2020 NY Slip Op 31638 (Sup. Ct. Kings Co. 2020)
3. **Describe the parallel facts:** Show how the facts mirror your case
4. **Quote the holding:** State what the court found
5. **Attach as exhibit:** Annex a copy of the decision to your attorney affirmation

This technique is especially powerful because:
- Trial court decisions may not be widely known to opposing counsel
- Recent decisions show the law is being actively applied
- Factual parallels are more persuasive than abstract legal principles

## Handling Opponent's Potential Arguments

### "Credibility Is for the Jury"
Pre-empt this argument by focusing on documentary evidence and admissions:

> Defendant's motion does not ask the Court to weigh credibility. Rather, Defendant relies on undisputed documentary evidence and Plaintiff's own admissions. When the documentary evidence conclusively establishes the facts, there is no credibility determination for the jury.

### "Discovery Is Incomplete"
Address any Rule 56(d) / CPLR 3212(f) issues:

> Plaintiff cannot avoid summary judgment by claiming discovery is incomplete. Full discovery has been conducted, including document production, interrogatories, and depositions of all key witnesses. Plaintiff has not identified any specific discovery that might yield evidence creating a genuine issue. Vague assertions of need for further discovery are insufficient to warrant denial. *See Paddington Partners v. Bouchard*, 34 F.3d 1132, 1138 (2d Cir. 1994).

### "Inferences Must Favor Non-Movant"
Acknowledge the standard while showing it doesn't help opponent:

> Defendant acknowledges that the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff. But even under this standard, Plaintiff cannot prevail. The undisputed documentary evidence is so one-sided that no reasonable jury could find for Plaintiff. Viewing the evidence favorably to Plaintiff means crediting Plaintiff's version of disputed facts—but it does not permit the Court to ignore uncontroverted documentary evidence or Plaintiff's own admissions.

## Citation Practice

### Citing the Record
- Statement of facts: (SMF ¶ 12)
- Affidavit: (Smith Aff. ¶ 5)
- Deposition: (Jones Dep. 45:10-15)
- Exhibit: (Ex. A at 3)
- Discovery response: (Pl.'s Resp. to Interrog. No. 5)

### Citing Cases
- Cite cases where summary judgment was granted on similar facts
- Quote holdings on the relevant legal standard
- Use parentheticals: *(granting summary judgment where plaintiff failed to...)*

## Point Headings

**Good (states conclusion with key fact):**
> I. PLAINTIFF'S FRAUD CLAIM FAILS BECAUSE THE UNDISPUTED EVIDENCE SHOWS PLAINTIFF CONDUCTED INDEPENDENT DUE DILIGENCE AND DID NOT RELY ON DEFENDANT'S REPRESENTATIONS

**Bad (states topic):**
> I. THE FRAUD CLAIM

## Length
- 3-6 pages per claim/defense
- Focus on dispositive issues
- Quality over quantity—one strong argument beats three weak ones
